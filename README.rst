Building the paper
==================

Install git, make, and conda. Install a TeX distribution, e.g. texlive, and
make sure the directly used packages are installed: nameref, hyperref, asmmath,
amssymb, siunitx, graphicx, todonotes, bibtex, and minted.

Clone the paper and the skijumpdesign repositories::

   $ git clone git@gitlab.com:mechmotum/ski-jump-analysis-paper.git
   $ cd ski-jump-analysis-paper

Create a conda environment for this project::

   $ conda env create -f environment.yml

This ``environment.yml`` pins the primary software dependencies to the exact
versions used to create the published paper.

Activate the environment::

   $ conda activate ski-analysis-paper

Build the paper::

   (ski-analysis-paper)$ make

The figures are generated by the following command inside the ``Makefile`` if
needed separately::

   (ski-analysis-paper)$ python src/case_study_figures.py

Updating the References
=======================

This Zotero collection is being used to generated the bib file:
