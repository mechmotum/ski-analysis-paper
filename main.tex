\section{Introduction}
%
Greater human-object impact velocity normal to the impact surface causes
greater injuries\todo{We need strong citations for this claim.}.
A common surrogate for measures impact velocity is ``equivalent fall height''.
Equivalent fall height provides a conceptually simple interpretation of the
danger from impact.
The equivalent fall height of ski and snowboard jumps can be calculated if the
Cartesian coordinates of the cross-sectional profile at the jumper's path
center line and takeoff angle are available.
Reduction in the equivalent fall height is one of several design factors that
can reduce injury.

This paper 1) explains why equivalent fall height is important to assess in
jump design, 2) explains how to measure the Cartesian coordinates of a jump, 3)
shows how to calculate equivalent fall height, 3) details a user-friendly web
application for calculating equivalent fall height, and 4) uses some cases
studies to show how dangerous past constructed jumps can be.

\subsection{Moral Imperative}
%
Reducing the risk of injuries on manufactured jumps motivates this work.
Intelligent, engineering design based on classical mechanics shapes features to
limit EFH. This complies with the first canon of engineering ethics ``Hold
paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public''. In the context of
snow sport safety, the first canon compels engineers to direct their technical
expertise to protecting snow sport participants from injuries.

People unfamiliar with the legal and insurance systems in the United States
might fail to appreciate that technical literature is corrupted in the defense
of unsafe practices and corporate profits. Peer-reviewed, technical literature
provides support for testimony in U.S. lawsuits. Plaintiffs and defendants both
hire their own experts to testify. Authors of technical papers can make money
by testifying. When it is for the defense, this testimony can result in denying
compensation to injuries, and serves to prolong unsafe practices in snowsports.
Rarely do experts report any conflicts of interest in their papers and
presentations, or when they organize and chair meetings or edit publications.
Financial support for publications used by expert witnesses can be routed
through consulting companies to pretend some deniability of conflicts in their
papers.

Designing jumps to limit EFH and reduce the risk of injuries is based on
well-known and well-established laws of mechanics. The concept that designing
jumps to limit EFH and control energy dissipation rates can reduce the risk is
irrefutable. It is basic physics. To counter this solid, fundamental,
scientific concept for defense experts, confounding factors are introduced.
These serve to cloud and confuse the basic issues. Consider three examples of
papers co-authored by well-known defense experts who testify for the ski
industry in ski injury cases. \cite{Shealy2010} conducted a study of the
influence of take-off speeds on landing locations with a series of jumpers who
appeared to use the feature and show that the people who jumped while they were
measuring land within a narrow region. \cite{Shealy2015} total serious
injury rates appear not to have changed while of terrain parks increased. In an
article on landing positions \cite{Scher2015} show that body orientation at
impact is important. The first two studies do a poor job of isolating
variables, and were not intended to, and the third suffers from restriction of
range. None of these papers are intended to reduce injury rates. No ways are
suggested in which their findings could be used to promote the safety, health
and welfare of the public.

Testifying for an injured plaintiff, or to defend corporations, in injury
cases, are not equivalent actions ethically, neither is authoring apparently
all kinds of conflicting papers on injuries. The former attempts to address in
problems that cause injuries, holding paramount the safety health and welfare
of the public. The latter attempts to defend the practices that might have
contributed to the injury to limit financial losses of insurance companies.
Proverbial two sides to every question do not exist in science and engineering.
Experiments in snowsports, no matter how expensive and sophisticated the
instrumentation, are not going to disprove the fundamental laws of classical
mechanics. If some statics or experimental results do not seem to support work
based on classical mechanics, then there is a problem with the statistical or
experimental design or their interpretation, and not with classical mechanics.
Defending practices that lead to injuries at the service of industry can
prolong these practices, which can lead to further injuries, clearly violating
the first canon of engineering ethics.

\section{Equivalent Fall Height}
%
\emph{Equivalent fall height} is a commonly used as proxy measure for impact
danger by numerous industries and safety standards~\cite{Hubbard2012}. It
represents the required kinetic energy dissipated on impact from a given
height. On the earth's surface this energy is given by the well known equation
$mgh$. This literally is the energy available to injure in a non-rotating fall.
The ability of this energy to injure can be reduced by controlling the impact
circumstances, e.g. impact cushioning, body orientation, and body
configuration, but the energy must be dissipated. Larger equivalent fall
heights require more intricate digitation measures to reduce injury.

Equivalent fall height is a particularly useful measure of danger due to its
interpretability by people. We have builtin danger sensors when faced with
drops of large heights and we have strong common sense for relating fall height
to likelihood of injury due to experience with falls and observation of others'
falls. For example, we have a sense of the danger associated from falling from
building storeys of increasing magnitude. Ground floor falls are on the order
of 1.5~\si{\meter}, second storey are 4.6~\si{\meter}, third
storey~\si{\meter}, fourth storey 10.7~\si{\meter} and so on. OSHA considers
1.8~\si{\meter} fall heights beyond the acceptable limit for workplace safety
and the FAA's safety regulations for safe parachuting landings is a
3~\si{\meter} fall height. As for skiing, the standards for the Olympic ski
jumping call for equivalent fall heights of 0.46~\si{\meter}.

% first, second, third, and fourth floor fall heights based on Vish2005
%5, 15, 25, 35 ft
%1.5, 4.6, 7.6, 10.7 m

The equivalent fall height $h$ of an object is formally defined as
%
\begin{align}
  h = \frac{v^2}{2g}
  \label{eq:efh_general}
\end{align}
%
where $v$ is the impact velocity of an object and $g$ is the acceleration due
to gravity. This definition results from equating the kinetic energy of an
object moving at velocity $v$ with the potential energy of the same object at a
height $h$ above the ground. To calculate the
equivalent fall height when impact is at an angle from the impact surface, the
equation becomes
%
\begin{align}
  h = v_{\perp}^2/2g
  \label{eq:efh_slope}
\end{align}
%
where $v_{\perp}$ is the velocity perpendicular to the impact surface. With
this in mind, the equivalent fall height of a ski slope can be found by
defining the Cartesian coordinates of jump cross section in the jumper's flight
path. We select the takeoff point to be the origin of this coordinate system,
as it is a common feature of most jumps.
For the jumper to have a low impact velocity, and thus small equivalent fall
height, there must only be a small misalignment between the takeoff\todo{Should
this be landing angle? Or is this referring to the case of a flat surface?}
angle, $\theta$, and the slope angle, $\phi$.
%
\begin{align}
  v_{\perp} = \sqrt{2gh} = v\sin(\theta - \phi)
\end{align}

If no aerodynamic forces is assumed, the projectile equations show that x, y
system is linear and quadratic in time.\todo{Not sure what this sentence is
supposed to mean}.
Inverting the parabola gives the initial velocity, $v_o$ required to reach a
given location:
%
\begin{align}
  v_o = \sqrt{\frac{x^2g}{2(x \tan \theta_o -y)\cos^{2}\theta}}
\end{align}

Using the above equations, the equivalent fall height h is a function of only
four variables: takeoff angle $\theta$, landing coordinates $(x, y)$, and the slope of
the landing surface $\frac{dy}{dx}$ also written as $\tan\phi$. Given a takeoff
angle, one can either solve for the slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ given equivalent fall
height $h$ or the equivalent fall height given the impact slope $\phi$. The
following equations show the two forms where the first is useful in designing
jumps with a specified equivalent fall height and the second is useful in
evaluating an existing jump.
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{dy}{dx} = \tan\left[\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2y(x)}{x} - \tan\theta\right) +
    \sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{h}{\frac{x^2}{4(x\tan\theta -
    y(x))\cos^{2}\theta} - y(x)}}\right] \\
  h = \left[\frac{x^2}{4(x\tan\theta - y)\cos^{2}\theta} -
    y\right]\sin^{2}\left[\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2y}{x}- \tan\theta\right)- \tan^{-1}\frac{dy}{dx}\right]
  \label{eq:efh}
\end{align}

Jumpers are subject to aerodynamic drag. If included there is no closed form
solution for the equivalent fall height, but the equivalent fall height can be
computed through simulation. The jumper's flight path is found by integrating
the flight equations of motion at various takeoff velocities and computing the
misalignment in jumper landing angle and the slope angle to then find the
equivalent fall height.


\todo[inline]{Clearly articulate the assumptions made in our calculations. We
  should also reiterate how some aspects are negligible, as Mont has described
  in prior papers.}


\section{Jump Shape Measurement}
%
The form of Equation~\ref{eq:efh} requires the Cartesian coordinates and the
slope at each coordinate to compute the equivalent fall height. Direct
measurements of the coordinates can be done with surveying equipment or
accurate GPS tools and indirect measurements can be done less expensively, but
more laboriously with a tape measure and level or specialized tools like the
Park Profiler. Differential GPS is a particularly nice method for collecting
data.

Consumer grade differential GPS units can measure the Cartesian coordinates
directly with 1~\si{\centi\meter} accuracy up to 1~\si{\kilo\meter}
distances from the base station. For example, we have used the 1500 Piksi
differential GPS system (SwiftNav, San Francisco, USA) to record slope shapes
from a roving skier with GPS antenaee mounted to the helmet. To measure, the
skier slowly slides up the takeoff ramp and stops at the takeoff point. At
the takeoff point, the skier makes a T shape by moving side to side on the
ramp. This T shape is important to determine the center of origin for the EFH
analysis. 



\section{Software and Online Access}
%
Previously, we developed software for designing ski jumps with a constant
equivalent fall height~\cite{Moore2018}. The software comprises of a general
purpose, extensible, object oriented software library with tools for 2D skiing
simulation. Using the library code, a web application was developed for
interactive jump design. The web application is designed for a non-technical
end user and usable on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device; any device that
supports a web browser.

We have extended the capabilities of the software in version 0.1.4 for the
purposes of the work described in this paper. New library features were added
that automate the calculation of equivalent fall height for jump profiles
described by a series of Cartesian coordinates.
Listing~\ref{lis:example-efh-calc} demonstrates creating a surface from some
measured data points and then calculating the equivalent fall height at
0.2\si{\meter} increaments.

\section{Case Studies}
%
Below we present two case studies derived from court proceedings in the United
States in which the jury ruled in favor of the injured plaintiffs, in that
there was a neglect in the design and construction of the jumps and that
contributed significantly to the injury severity of the jumpers.

\todo[inline]{Each one of these cases tells a story of why EFH matters.}

\subsection{Charlene Vine v Bear Valley Ski Company}
%
In April of 2000, Ms. Charlene Vine's spine was broken when she crashed on a
jump constructed at the Bear Valley Ski Resort in California, USA. The jump
shape was that of a ``tabletop'' which is a common shape of terrain park jumps.
It is the jump constructor's intent that jumpers fully clear the table; landing
on the so called ``sweet spot'' when jumping, but Ms.~Vine landed short of the
end of the table.
Compounding the danger of a short landing, this jump's tabletop, which is
would typically be flat and level, was concave.
At the 11 meter horizontal landing distance from the takeoff point the surface
was sloped upwards approximately 5 degrees.
The upper panel of Figure~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley} shows a reasonable
approximation of the jump (in black) at Bear Valley Ski Resort based on
measurements taken of the jump for the trial.
The shape of this surface highlights the detrimental effect of misaligning the
surface tangent with the jumper's flight path at impact.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.25in]{figures/vine-v-bear-valley.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Measured Bear Valley ski jump compared to a possible design}
  The upper panel shows the cross section of the measured landing surface in as
  a solid black line. Example flight paths are shown with dashed and dotted
  black lines from the 30~\si{\degree} takeoff angle. The
  13~\si{\meter\per\second} takeoff speed is used as the design speed for a
  jump designed with constant equivalent fall height in solid green for
  comparison. The lower panel shows the equivalent fall height for both jumps
  in corresponding colors at 1~\si{\meter} intervals. The numbers above the
  vertical bars indicate the takeoff speed in meters per second required to
  land at that location. Orange lines indicate relatable fall heights.}
  \label{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}
\end{figure}

The lower panel plots the equivalent fall height for different landing
locations on the Bear Valley jump. It is clear that short of the knuckle, the
equivalent fall height is its highest. At 11 meters, Ms.~Vine's fall height was
about 4 meters, which is equivalent to falling from between one or two storeys.
The average fall heights for 1 and 2 storey falls shown are estimated from data
presented in \cite{Vish2005}.  Ms.~Vine's body had also rotated, such that she
landed on her upper spine and was paralyzed as a result of the nearly two
storey fall. The larger the equivalent fall height, the larger the impact
forces. A lower equivalent fall height would have decreased the possibility of
spinal injury, due to the lower impact forces.

On this jump, if the jumper's landing position is less than 5~\si{\meter} or
greater than 18~\si{\meter} the equivalent fall height is less than that which
causes knee collapse~\cite{Minetti1998}, but in the range that jumpers are more
likely to land the equivalent fall height can become quite dangerous,
especially if the jumper rotates for a fall on their head as Ms.~Vine did. If a
jumper lands in the area at the end of the concave tabletop, it is equivalent
to falling out of a second storey window. In contrast, a landing surface
designed to have a constant equivalent fall height can be created with a
similar amount of construction costs that would could reduce the fall height.

The green jump profile in the upper panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley} shows a possible jump design, derived from
a 13 m/s design speed~\cite{Levy2015}, of similar size with similar possible
flight times that ensures a constant equivalent fall height of 1~\si{\meter}.
The convex shape of this jump is interestingly close to what one would get if
the original tabletop were inverted, showing how the convex nature of the jump
shape is critically important to control equivalent fall height. A jump of this
design would have lowered impact forces for any orientation landing at any
possible landing location. In 2002, the jury ruled in favor of Ms.~Vine,
agreeing that Bear Valley was responsible for designing safer
jumps~\cite{Alvarado2002}.

\subsection{Kenneth Salvini v Ski Lifts Inc.}
%
In 2004, Kenneth Salvini attempted a table top jump with skis in the terrain
park of the The Summit at Snoqualmie ski resort in Snoqalmie, Washington, USA.
In this case, Mr.~Salvini overshot the location the jump builders' intended
landing location even while traveling at expected skiing speeds. Mr.~Salvini
somersaulted during flight and landed on his back, ultimately causing
quadriplegia. At his landing location the equivalent fall height was over 10
meters, approximately a 4 storey fall height.
Figure~\ref{fig:salvini-v-snoqualmie} shows the reconstruction of the jump
profile in a solid black line based on measurements in the court proceedings.
For takeoff speeds greater than 13~\si{\meter\per\second}
(47~\si{\kilo\meter\per\hour}), the lower panel shows, also in black, that the
equivalent fall height is greater than 8 meters and grows linear with larger
takeoff speeds. Severe injury is almost certain from falls this high,
especially so if landing in a way that causes undue forces to the spine, as in
Mr.~Salvini's case.

The green curve in the upper panel is the profile of a jump designed with a
1~\si{\meter} equivalent fall height for maximum speeds of
17~\si{\meter\per\second}. This profile requires significantly more snow than
the measured jump but alleviates the dangerous impacts possible in the measured
jump.

This jump highlights how extreme the equivalent fall height can be if the jump
is not designed. Few recreational skiers will jump out of a four storey window,
snow landing or not. The likelihood of injury is quite clear and our internal
altimeter.

  jump designed with constant equivalent fall height in solid green for

\section{Conclusion}
%
There are, of course, more factors than jump landing surface shape that
contribute to injuries on terrain park jumps but impact velocity can be easily
controlled with a designed landing surface. There is no evidence to support
that decreasing equivalent fall height increases injuries in falls, only
evidence that suggests injuries can be decreased. Thus there is no reason not
to adopt constant equivalent fall heights of low values for public use jump
designs. Common sense is reall all that is needed to believe that falling from
higher heights will increase injury to human bodies regardless of other
factors.
