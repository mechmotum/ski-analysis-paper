\begin{abstract}
  Most American snowsport resorts now have terrain parks and decades-long
  epidemiological evidence correlates terrain park use with injuries.
  Engineering design of jumps could reduce injuries by limiting equivalent fall
  heights, which are proportional to dissipated landing impact energy.  No
  evidence refutes making terrain park jumps safer in this way. We discuss case
  studies illustrating that large equivalent fall heights are significant
  factors in traumatic injuries on terrain park jumps. We argue that it is the
  ethical responsibility of engineers to ensure the safety, health, and welfare
  of the public when performing and presenting research on snowsport safety.
  Developing standards and adopting design tools for builders can make jumps
  safer. We introduce an online tool that can evaluate existing jumps as well
  as design jump profiles with safer equivalent fall heights to
  reduce injuries as an example proactive practice.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
%
Impacts with fixed surfaces can cause injury. Greater velocities, perpendicular
to the surfaces, provide greater injury potential due to increased kinetic
energy dissipation. Equivalent fall height (EFH) is a conceptually simple and
familiar measure of impact danger used in safety standards worldwide, from
construction~\cite{OSHA2021} to children's playground
equipment~\cite{Chalmers1996}. EFHs of terrain park jumps can be calculated
using techniques in \cite{Levy2015} from Cartesian coordinates of jump
profiles. These must include starting points, takeoff ramps, and landing hills,
all along jumpers' paths. Limiting energy dissipation in human bodies, hence
EFH on jumps, reduces the likelihood and severity of injuries. EFH should be a
primary attribute of jump design. It must be considered because it is clearly
connected to injury risk and can be used to design and construct safer jumps.

Societal costs of jump injuries are discussed here with case studies that
illustrate dangers if EFH is not limited appropriately. We also discuss papers
presented as ski safety research, which attempt to sow doubt about EFH
relevance and snow sport danger, written by authors that regularly provide
expert testimony defending the ski industry in personal injury lawsuits.
Proposals for improved safety are absent in the papers. We present a
user-friendly web application that can facilitate jumping injury reduction by
calculating EFH on current and future jumps.

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:hist}
%
Terrain park jumps are not new. Gradual introduction in the 1980's was
accompanied by increased interest in aerial maneuvers and extreme sports
participation. Jumps have proliferated since and are today nearly ubiquitous.
Roughly 95\% of US ski resorts include terrain parks. Unfortunately, this
growth correlates with injuries. Two early longitudinal studies in the 1980's
and early 1990's~\cite{Deibert1998,Furrer1995} already found significant
increases in head injuries and concussions. Between 1993 and 1997 head injuries
accompanied most skiing and snowboarding deaths~\cite{CPSC1999}. Koehle et
al.~\cite{Koehle2002} stated ``[S]eventy-seven percent of spinal
injuries~\cite{Tarazi1999} and 30\% of head injuries~\cite{Fukuda2001} in
snowboarding were a result of jumps.'' Jackson et al.~\cite{Jackson2004}
determined that by 2004 snow skiing replaced football as the second leading
cause of serious head and spinal cord injuries in America.

These early increasing injury assessments persisted. According to
\cite{Russell2014}, ``between 5 and 27\% of skiing and snowboarding injuries
occur[red] in terrain parks
\cite{Bridges2003,Goulet2007,Moffat2009,Greve2009,Brooks2010,Ruedl2013}''.
Incredibly, at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games more than a third of all
snowboard half-pipe and slope-style competitors were injured~\cite{Ruedl2012}.
Epidemiological research~\cite{Carus2016,Audet2020,Hosaka2020} continues to
show that injuries on terrain park jumps are more likely and more severe than
on normal slopes. Audet et.~al~\cite{Audet2020} provides evidence that skiing
or snowboarding in a terrain park is a risk factor for head, neck, back, and
other severe injuries. Hosaka et. al~\cite{Hosaka2020} concludes that jumping
is a main cause for serious spinal injuries, regardless of skill level, and
suggests that, because spinal injuries incidence  have not decreased over time,
the ski industry should focus on designing fail-safe jump features to minimize
risks of serious spinal injuries. Similar suggestions have appeared in
peer-reviewed literature for more than a
decade~\cite{Hubbard2009,Swedberg2012,Hubbard2012,McNeil2012,McNeil2012a,Hubbard2015,Levy2015,Petrone2017,Moore2018}.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Equivalent Fall Height}
\label{sec:efh}
%
\emph{EFH}, a common proxy measure for impact danger in industrial safety
standards, is the weight-specific kinetic energy that must be dissipated on
falling impact from height $h$~\cite{Muller1995,Hubbard2009,Gasser2018}.
Initial potential energy $mgh$ is transformed to kinetic energy available to
injure in non-rotating falls. Injury potential can be reduced by controlling
impact circumstances, e.g. impact cushioning, and body orientation,
configuration, and motion; however this energy must still be dissipated. Larger
EFHs require more elaborate measures to reduce injury; reducing EFH does not.

EFH can be interpreted by the general public. People have an intuitive sense of
danger when faced with potential falls from large heights and a strong
experiential common sense for relating fall height to likelihood of injury.
People sense increasing danger associated with falling from larger heights
because injury severity increases with increasing fall height~\cite{Nau2021}.
Ground, second, and third floor falls are about 2.6, 5.1, 8.8~\si{\meter},
respectively~\cite{Vish2005}. The German Society for Trauma Surgery's threshold
for trauma team activation is a fall height of 3~\si{\meter}
\cite{PolytraumaGuidelineUpdateGroup2018}. The US Occupational Safety and
Health Administration has for decades required protection for heights greater
than 1.2~\si{\meter} for general workplace safety~\cite{OSHA2021}.  Chalmers et
al.~\cite{Chalmers1996} argues for 1.5~\si{\meter} maximum fall heights for
playground equipment. The Swiss Council for Accident Prevention makes specific
recommendations for EFHs below 1.5~\si{\meter} for terrain park jumps requiring
basic skills~\cite{Heer2019}.  Even with no standards in Olympic Nordic ski
jumps, typical ``equivalent landing height``~\cite{Gasser2018} is only about
0.5~\si{\meter}.

EFH $h$ of objects is formally defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  h = \frac{v^2}{2g}
  \label{eq:efh_general}
\end{equation}
%
where $v$ is impact velocity and $g$ gravitational acceleration.  Kinetic
energy of objects moving at  velocity $v$  is transformed from potential energy
at height $h$; indisputable, fundamental physics.

Beginning from equation~\ref{eq:efh_general} equivalent fall heights $h$ can be
determined for any surface, i.e., sloped landing profile or shape, after
jumping~\cite{Petrone2017}. The result, neglecting air drag, is
%
\begin{align}
  h = \left[\frac{x^2}{4(x\tan\theta_T - y)\cos^{2}\theta_T} - y\right]
    \sin^{2}
    \left[\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2y}{x} - \tan\theta_T\right) -
    \tan^{-1}\frac{dy}{dx}\right]
  \label{eq:efh}
\end{align}
%
a function only of takeoff angle $\theta_T$, impact coordinates $(x,y)$
relative to takeoff, and landing surface slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$, but not a
function of takeoff speed~\cite{Petrone2017}. To analyze jumps, one measures
Cartesian coordinates of landing surfaces along jumpers' flight paths and
takeoff angles. Slopes $\frac{dy}{dx}$ are computed from measured coordinates
$(x,y)$. Curvature for the last several meters before takeoffs must be near
zero to avoid unintentional inversion, although this does not influence EFHs.

\subsection{Software and Online Access}
\label{sec:software}
%
We presented the first version of software for designing ski jumps with a
specified EFH in \cite{Moore2018}. It comprises a general-purpose, extensible,
object-oriented software library with tools for 2D skiing simulation. Using
this code, a web application was developed for interactive jump design. The web
application is designed for a non-technical end-user and operable on any
desktop, tablet, or mobile device supporting a web browser.

We have extended the capabilities of the software in version 1.4.0 (March 25,
2021) to assist the work described in this paper. New library features automate
calculation of EFH for jump profiles described by a set of Cartesian
coordinates.  Additionally, a new ``analysis'' page allows users to upload
measured jump profile coordinates in either a .CSV or Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet file. The jump is then analyzed and the equivalent fall height is
displayed graphically for interactive user manipulation and viewing.
Figure~\ref{fig:web-app-screenshot} shows the web application with one of the
case study jumps (Salvini v. Ski Lifts Inc.) loaded for analysis and explains
its primary features.

  \caption{\textbf{Screenshot of the ski jump design and analysis web app} To
    use the analysis portion of the app, a user selects ``Ski Jump Analysis''
    from the primary menu [1], uploads a .CSV or .XLS file by dragging it onto
    the screen [3], inspects the input data for accuracy in the table [4], sets
    the takeoff angle [5], runs the analysis by pressing the ``Run Analysis''
    button [6], views the results in the interactive plot [2], and downloads
    the results by pressing the ``Download EFH'' button [7].}
  \label{fig:web-app-screenshot}
\end{figure}

The software is written in Python and directly depends on popular packages
including Cython~\cite{Behnel2011}, matplotlib~\cite{Hunter2007},
NumPy~\cite{Oliphant2006}, pandas~\cite{McKinney2020}, Plotly \&
Dash~\cite{Plotly2015}, pycvodes~\cite{Dahlgren2018},
SciPy~\cite{Virtanen2020}, SymPy~\cite{Meurer2017}, and xlrd. The software is
open source and licensed under the MIT redistribution license. The source code
is distributed on PyPi~\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/skijumpdesign}}.
Users can submit bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, and
additions at the Gitlab
repository~\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/moorepants/skijumpdesign}}. The
software library's documentation is hosted through Read The
Docs~\footnote{\url{https://skijumpdesign.readthedocs.io}}.  Basic examples of
using the library are provided in the documentation and this paper's
supplementary materials. The web app is hosted for free use at
\url{http://www.skijumpdesign.info}.

We do not view the software as the definitive ski jump design and analysis
tool, but rather as a foundation. The tool has been released as open-source so
that refinements and modifications are easy and encouraged. The software was
carefully designed with extensibility and modularity in mind. New surface
shapes such as different takeoff ramps are easily added by building upon the
basic surface object using object-oriented programming principles. Similarly,
new skier models can be added that incorporate more complex biomechanical
features and actions. We make use of this flexible software design for the web
application and for the calculations and visualizations presented in the
following section.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:case}
%
In these case studies of American lawsuits, juries ruled for injured
plaintiffs. Negligent jump design and construction contributed significantly to
injuries~\cite{SuperiorCourtSanFranciscoCounty2002,KingCountySuperiorCourt2008}.
Simulations below use methods in \cite{Levy2015}, assuming the same skier mass,
frontal area, and drag coefficient of 75~\si{\kg}, 0.34~\si{\meter\squared},
and 0.821, respectively.

\subsection{Vine v. Bear Valley Ski Company}
\label{sec:vine}
%
In April 2000, Ms.~Vine's lower spine was injured when she landed badly skiing
a jump at Bear Valley in California. The jump shape
(Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}) was a common form called a ``table-top''.
Builders intend that jumpers completely clear the table, landing on down-slopes
near a ``sweet spot''.  The upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}
shows the  measured jump surface from accident investigation. Vine landed short
of the knuckle (end of the table-top). This table-top, typically flat and
horizontal, was instead concave, compounding dangers of short landings. At the
11~\si{\meter} landing horizontal distance measured from  takeoff, the surface
sloped upwards approximately 5\si{\degree}. The concave shape emphasizes
detrimental effects of not aligning surface tangents closer to jumper flight
paths at impact.
%

  constant EFH of 1~\si{\meter}.

  }
  \label{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}
\end{figure}

The lower panel displays EFH at different landing locations, which is greatest
just short of the knuckle.  At the sweet spot just past the knuckle the EFH
drops precipitously to  about 1~\si{\meter} but landing in this narrow region
requires jumpers to control takeoff speeds within 1~\si{\meter\per\second}.
Landing at 11 meters, Vine's EFH was almost 4 meters, equivalent to falling
from between one and two stories~\cite{Vish2005}. She had also rotated backward
in flight, landed on her lower spine and was paralyzed. A lower EFH could have
decreased likelihood of injury, due to lower impact forces.

In contrast, landing surfaces designed to have smaller EFHs can be created at
similar cost. The green jump profile in the upper panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley} shows a possible jump design,
see~\cite{Levy2015}, of similar size with similar flight times that ensures a
constant (smaller) EFH of about 1~\si{\meter}. The convex shape of this jump is
interestingly close to the original concave table-top  inverted, showing that
convex landing shapes are critically important for limiting EFHs. This
alternative jump design would have lowered impact forces for landings at all
locations. In 2002, the jury ruled in favor of Ms.~Vine, agreeing that Bear
Valley was responsible for not designing safer jumps.

\subsection{Salvini v. Ski Lifts Inc.}
\label{sec:salvini}
%
In 2004, Mr.~Salvini attempted a table-top jump on skis in the terrain park of
The Summit at Snoqualmie Ski Resort, in Washington state. Salvini overshot the
intended landing location while traveling at typical skiing speeds, rotated
backward during flight and landed on his back, ultimately suffering
quadriplegia. At his landing location of 30~\si{\meter} the EFH exceeded 10
meters, approximately a 3-story fall. Figure~\ref{fig:salvini-v-snoqualmie}
shows the measured jump surface from the accident investigation.  For takeoff
speeds greater than 13~\si{\meter\per\second}, the lower panel shows that the
EFH is greater than 10~\si{\meter} and growing linearly with larger takeoff
speeds. Severe injury is almost certain in falls this high, especially if
landing body orientation loads the spine, as in this case.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/salvini-v-snoqualmie.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Snoqualmie jump compared to possible safer design}
  Top: Measured landing surface (solid black) and jumper flight paths
  (intermittent black) for measured 25\si{\degree} takeoff angle. The
  16~\si{\meter\per\second} takeoff speed is used as the design speed for a
  comparison jump (solid green) with constant EFH of
  1~\si{\meter}.
  Bottom: Equivalent fall height for both jumps in corresponding colors at
  2~\si{\meter} intervals. Numbers above bars indicate takeoff speed required
  to land at that location.

  2\textsuperscript{nd} story fall, and average 3\textsuperscript{rd} story
  fall.
  }
  \label{fig:salvini-v-snoqualmie}
\end{figure}

The upper panel also shows a jump profile (green) designed to have a
1~\si{\meter} EFH for all speeds below
16~\si{\meter\per\second}. This profile requires significantly more snow than
the measured jump but alleviates dangerous impacts.

This jump highlights how extreme EFHs can become if jumps are not properly
designed. Few recreational skiers will jump out three story windows, snow or
not. Injuries are clearly likely. Our internal altimeter tells us so, but it's
not easy to discern when visually assessing a jump's safety.

These two case studies clearly demonstrate that deficient jump landing shapes
have devastating consequences and that engineering analysis and design, based
on laws of mechanics, can be used to shape jump landings that limit EFHs.
Designing jumps this way is based on well-established, centuries-old mechanics
of Isaac Newton and Émilie du Châtelet~\cite{Zinsser2007}, fundamental to
physics and engineering education. Designing jumps to limit EFHs appropriately
reduces injury risks by reducing impact energies, absolutely.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Moral Imperative}
\label{sec:moral}
%
``Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the
public''~\cite{NSPE2019}, is the first canon of engineering ethics. Ethics is
not a matter of opinion and should not be optional. It is the foundation for
engineering. The first canon compels engineers to use their technical expertise
to protect snowsport participants from injuries. No one can rationally argue
that reducing EFH increases likelihood of injury. Building well designed, safer
jumps is no more laborious than building poorly designed, unsafe jumps. We see
no reason not to control EFHs with good design methods. Nonetheless skiing
industries and their insurance companies are reluctant to adopt and endorse
such design methods, choosing instead to spend money and energy on litigation
defense rather than on technology for constructing safer jumps. They hire
expert witness engineers to sow doubt on simple, basic physics, while ignoring
the first canon. What is their excuse for inaction?

In their book ``Merchants of Doubt''~\cite{Oreskes2010}, Oreskes and Conway
have studied this problem more generally. They show that in numerous industries
over the last 60 years, scientific evidence accumulated that commonly accepted
industrial activities were harmful, either to individuals or society. But the
industries had vested interests in continuing the status quo since operational
changes would have led to significant, short-term costs. Examples carefully
described and analyzed~\cite{Oreskes2010} are the use of DDT, smoking tobacco,
acid rain due to coal-fired power plants, ozone hole caused by CFCs,
second-hand tobacco smoke’s effects, and CO2-caused climate change, among
others. Rather than using the proven science as a basis for changes in
practice, strategic responses of industries have been to ``emphasize the
controversy among scientists and the need for continued
research''~\cite{Oreskes2010}.

This same strategy is used by the snowsport industry and its defense experts.
To sow doubt and counter solid, fundamental, scientific concepts of landing
hill design limiting EFH, defense experts introduce confounding factors to
cloud and confuse basic issues. Consider as evidence three papers
\cite{Shealy2010,Shealy2015,Scher2015} co-authored by well-known skiing
industry defense experts who have testified for the snowsport resorts and their
insurance companies. We do not fundamentally question their empirical findings
but we do reject their interpretation of the findings, namely their conclusion
that greater fall height is not a cause of greater injury.

Shealy et.~al~\cite{Shealy2010} conducted an experimental study attempting to
test the hypothesis that takeoff speed is a predictor of the distance from a
jump take-off to landing. They reached the mechanically impossible conclusions
both that there is ``no statistically significant relationship between takeoff
speed and the distance traveled'' and that ``takeoff speed is not a dominant or
controlling factor (in how far a jumper travels)''~\cite{Shealy2010}. These
conclusions were used to question the soundness of analytical mechanical
modeling of jumper flight used in \cite{Hubbard2009,McNeil2012}.

Some of these same authors later vouched for terrain park jump safety. Using
data held by the National Ski Areas Association (NSAA), Shealy et.
al~\cite{Shealy2015} concluded that their ``hypothesis that jumping features
resulted in an increase risk of injury [was] not ...
substantiated.''~\cite{Shealy2015} This is the only study we are aware of with
this conclusion. It is difficult to reconcile it with the voluminous
contradictory research documenting the unique dangers posed by terrain park
jumps in tens of other studies cited both herein and in
\cite{Hubbard2009,Swedberg2012,McNeil2012,McNeil2012a,Hubbard2015,Levy2015,Petrone2017,Moore2018}.
Although NSAA releases yearly the total of resort-related fatalities and
catastrophic injuries, the selected raw data on which \cite{Shealy2015} was
based is not even publicly available to other researchers!

In a third experimental study (N=13) specifically designed ``to evaluate injury
mitigation potential of surfaces limiting EFH''~\cite{Scher2015}, Scher et al.
clearly show that body orientation, i.e. falling directly on one's head (in all
trials), can cause dangerous cervical spine compression loads~\cite{Scher2015},
even at low fall heights. They report on effects of EFH but only test heights
from \SIrange{0.23}{1.52}{\meter}, committing a similar fault as in
\cite{Shealy2010}, restricting ranges of their independent variables, and
ignoring fall heights known to have caused severe injuries regardless of body
orientation. Yet they insinuate that EFH has no appreciable effect on injuries.
The title, ``Terrain Park Jump Design: Would Limiting Equivalent Fall Height
Reduce Spinal Injuries?'' implies that they appear to believe that falling from
greater heights might \emph{not} cause greater injuries. Why propose such
mechanically flawed hypotheses?

Extending the scope of the findings in these ways are common statistical
mistakes, but ones that should not be made by professional engineers.
Fundamental laws cannot be disproved by these kinds of jumping experiments. If
statistical or experimental results seem in conflict with predictions from
classical mechanics, the problems are most certainly with the statistical or
experimental design or their interpretations, but not fundamental laws of
mechanics. Defending practices that lead to injuries helps prolong these
dangerous practices, which leads to further injuries, clearly contradictory to
ethical engineering. Ski industry defense engineering experts are complicit in
the continued societal damage. As Upton Sinclair wrote ``it is difficult to get
a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding
it''~\cite{Sinclair1994}.

It is not evident that these papers (\cite{Shealy2010,Shealy2015,Scher2015})
``hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public''. They are
silent on how their findings can be used to reduce injuries. They obscure a
scientifically fundamental, mechanically irrefutable fact that impacting
surfaces at lower normal velocities is safer. They ``create the appearance that
the claims being promoted were scientific''~\cite[page 244]{Oreskes2010}.
Fundamental laws have made mechanics a science. Findings that contradict such
fundamental laws should be carefully scrutinized and review processes accepting
such articles should be questioned.

Organizations also merchandise doubt. A decade ago, NSAA argued~\cite{NSAA2008}
that, because of rider and snow variability, terrain park jump ``standards are
essentially impossible.'' While it is true that the ``virtually \ldots infinite
number of ways that a given feature may be used by an individual \ldots varying
speed, pop, body movement, takeoff stance, angles of approach, the attempting
of different kinds of maneuvers, landing stance, and the type of equipment used
(skis or snowboard) \ldots create a wide variety of experiences for the
users''~\cite{NSAA2008}, none of these in fact preclude analysis or design.
This was shown clearly in reference~\cite{Hubbard2012} which examined
quantitatively the effects of variations in factors actually involved in the
mechanics: takeoff speed, snow friction, air drag, tail wind, snow melt and
jumper pop. These so-called ``uncontrollable factors'' fell into three groups:
(1) those for which there is zero sensitivity, i.e., an uncontrollable factor
that makes no difference in the ability of the designed jump to deliver the
designed EFH; (2) those for which fairly large parameter variations cause only
insignificant maximum deviations in EFH, and (3) those for which the factor can
be taken into account in the design process itself and its larger effect on EFH
completely eliminated in the unsafe direction. The allegation that design of
limited EFH surfaces is prevented by the complexity of the problem and by the
large number and types of parameter variations away from nominal is false; in
fact the allegation is just more merchandised doubt.

%American legal, healthcare and insurance systems also corrupt technical literature for legal defense of unsafe practices. Peer-reviewed technical literature is used to support testimony in lawsuits. Both plaintiffs and defendants hire experts, authors of technical papers, to testify. When supporting the defense, this can result in denying compensation for injuries and prolonging unsafe practices. American healthcare systems can leave families of paralysis victims destitute with little recourse but to sue snowsport resorts. American health insurance companies also sue resorts to recover their losses in injury cases. Financial support for publications gets routed through consulting companies providing plausible deniability of actual conflicts. This defense support appears to present a conflict of interest which should be declared in papers and presentations, when organizing and chairing meetings, and when editing publications.

In injury cases, testifying for injured plaintiffs and testifying defending
corporations are not ethically equivalent. The former attempts to address
problems that cause injuries, holding paramount the public's safety, health and
welfare. The latter attempts to defend practices that might have contributed to
the injury, to limit financial losses of corporations. The idiom ``two sides to
every question'', is not appropriate in science and engineering~\cite[page
268]{Oreskes2010}.

\subsection{What Can Be Done?}
\label{sec:action}
%
Absolutely, the most important change will be to incorporate rigorous,
rational  processes and scientific principles that consider mechanical impact safety into designing freestyle jumps.
At present a large fraction of, if not most, jumps in the USA are created in a
formulaic way using two straight lines, a horizontal deck (tabletop) and nearly
constant-slope landing region, linked by a curved knuckle. This design philosophy is recommended in the instructions provided by the NSAA~\cite{NSAA2015} and is presumably followed by their members. Although such jumps are
simple and thus easy to design, previous research has shown that jumps with
bi-linear geometry have generally poor EFH behavior~\cite{Swedberg2012} and that they can have low EFH only in a small region just past the knuckle (called the ``sweet spot''). In the more recent version of their freestyle terrain park notebook~\cite{NSAA2015}, the jump landing area is even termed the ``landing plan'' because it is envisioned to be planar! There is no reference whatsoever to any concept such as EFH or similar measure of impact or its effect on safety because the NSAA's strategy is to put the responsibility for safety fully on the jumper. There is no
quantitative consideration of jump impact safety (e.g. from the point of view of EFH)
beyond seat-of-the-pants experience of the designer. The
skiing industry continues to resist more scientifically-based rational approaches to design, in spite of the fact that computer aided design (and even computer-assisted fabrication and maintenance) of snow park jumps (see
Figure~\ref{fig:prinoth}) has been available from snow groomer manufacturers
for more than 5 years~\cite{Muigg2019}. The 2015 NSAA reference in~\cite{NSAA2015} still contained the statement that ``Standards are essentially impossible\ldots'' We expect the 2021 version may also.

Once the jump surface has been designed, the next most important change is to build accurately what was designed. Presently a dominant fraction of jumps are simply
fabricated by groomer operators, based on perhaps a few measurements of
distances and slopes (deck length, takeoff angle, landing region angle and length) during the process. But the design concepts are overly simple and do not
incorporate or address quantitative indicators of safety such as EFH. The
introduction of computer controlled grooming(see Figure 4), similar to computer aided manufacturing
(CAM), will facilitate precise construction of more complex designed
shapes. These would include the non-trivial constant EFH surfaces provided by
our online ski jump design software that limit landing impulses to acceptable
levels.
%First year engineering students are able to machine components in two or three lab sessions using CNC that previously were only within reach of aspiring machinists after several weeks of their apprenticeship (WPI ME1800).

Every jumper (and parent of young jumpers) should be able to confirm that a
jump is safe before trying it. Appropriate inspection, evaluation, and
correction of existing jumps, and the design and construction of safer new
jumps should be promoted.  Postings should be required and include EFHs, the certified
inspectors name, and when last inspected.  Inspections should be frequent
enough to ensure that jumps meet the standards, particularly regarding takeoffs
and starting points to prevent inadvertent inversions. Standards need to be
developed that limit EFHs in collaboration between industry and research
engineers to design, build, inspect, maintain, and post safer jumps. An example
of first steps in this area is a terrain park safety guide by the Swiss Council
for Accident Prevention~\cite{Heer2019}.
%Standards are needed for jump designs with limited EFHs, specifying verification, inspection, and maintenance during use.

To complement standards, certification programs are needed for jump building,
inspection, and maintenance. As an example of a successful certification
program, around 1980 ASTM Committee F27 began to develop ski binding standards.
Proponents were led by orthopedic surgeons and academic
researchers~\cite{Bahniuk1996}. Industry argued that standards were impossible
because release value measurement was impossible by ski shops (industry now
makes similar arguments about jumps~\cite{NSAA2015}). Nevertheless certifications and
inspection standards for bindings were developed, which led to far fewer
lower-extremity equipment-related injuries. But now no medical professionals
and almost no academics remain in F27. Efforts to create similar standards for
terrain park ski jumps began in F27 more than a decade ago~\cite{SAM2011}, yet
no standards have yet been developed. The US skiing industry, aided by the NSAA, has
been successful in slow-walking the process in order to prevent standards.
% ASTM F27 COMMITTEE COULD BROADEN SCOPE TO INCLUDE PARK JUMPS SOON (2011) Ski Area Management https://www.saminfo.com/news/sam-headline-news/7425-5957-881-astm-f27-committee-could-broaden-scope-to-include-park-jumps-soon

In parallel with standards development, assessing and possibly reshaping
existing jumps to eliminate dangerous EFHs should be an straightforward route
for ski resorts to proactively increase terrain park safety. Accurate enough
measurements of existing surfaces can occur even with simple tools, e.g. tape
measure and digital level, and consume relatively little time and effort per
jump (see supplementary materials for details). Calculation and visualization
of EFHs from these measurements can take some time without a computational
program for calculating EFHs from hill profiles. The user-friendly,
freely-accessible open-source online web application tool that 
we have made available for jump designers and builders has almost instantaneous calculation and visualization steps, solving this problem.

With this software jump builders can easily add
safety assessment to their toolbox, even accessing it from a smartphone or
tablet on hills.  We see no reason that this basic assessment should not be
part of jump construction processes. The only ethical decision is to adopt
these methods; saving even one person from a life of paralysis, or even death,
must be worth the relatively minor inconvenience of shaping jumps using the
methods in reference~\cite{Levy2015}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
%
There are, of course, more factors than jump takeoff and landing surface shapes
that contribute to injuries on terrain park jumps. Yet normal impact velocity
can be easily controlled with a properly designed and fabricated landing
surface shape. There is no evidence that decreasing designed EFH increases
injuries in falls; injuries only decrease. Thus we see no reason not to adopt
constant low values of EFH for public-use jump designs. In fact, safety
research~\cite{Smith2020} tells us that designing forgiving environments (i.e.,
limiting EFH at all possible landing locations) is more effective than forcing
behavioral change (e.g., requiring the jumper to regulate their speed to ensure
a landing only in a small safe region). Fabricators of jumps that are not
designed with these principles in mind are negligent. The safety, health, and
welfare of the public involved in this sport must be held paramount.

A real limitation to reducing injuries, especially paralysis, on terrain park
jumps is that it cannot be accomplished just by publishing papers on scientific
design methods and providing software. Industry must adopt ethical,
user-focused procedures for designing, building, inspecting, and maintaining
safer terrain park jumps. As shown in the case studies above, jumps can have
EFHs comparable to falling from aerial ski lifts. Just like rules enforced by
states and insurance companies to prevent falls from lifts, similar standards
are needed for terrain park jumps. Public safety must be held paramount to
short-term return-on-investment.

%Should we remove this following paragraph??
Engineers whose scholarly work ignores engineering's first canon of ethics in
favor of merchandising doubt can diminish the scientific integrity of
engineering journals and engineering conferences. Journal editors should
recognize papers primarily intending to cast doubt on good science and
engineering for what they are, tools of insurance companies for defending civil
suits, and reject them. Papers helping to perpetuate dangerous practices do not
belong in engineering journals or conference proceedings.

The methods implemented in the software illustrated in
Section~\ref{sec:software} provide a starting point for realizing EFH-conscious
designs in terrain parks. We hope to see the design and analysis adopted by
commercial grooming equipment manufacturers so that safety is made integral to
jump design. Our software can grow and evolve through contributions from other
researchers to incorporate many other nuances of injury prevention. We also see
the methods providing a structure for standards development. And minimally, we
see the software as an immediately usable tool for jump fabricators in the
field.
