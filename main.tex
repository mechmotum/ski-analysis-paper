\begin{abstract}
  Most American snowsport resorts have terrain parks. Decades long
  epidemiological evidence correlates terrain park use with injuries.
  Engineering design of jump could reduced injuries by limiting equivalent fall
  heights (EFHs), indicating impact energy dissipated when landing. No evidence
  refutes  making terrain park jumps safer in this way. We discuss case studies
  illustrating that large EFHs are significant factors in traumatic injuries on
  terrain park jumps. Standards and an online tool for builders can make jumps
  safer. This tool can evaluate existing jumps and design jump profiles with
  safe equivalent EFHs to reduce injuries.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
%
Impacts with fixed surfaces can  cause injury. Greater velocities,
perpendicular to the surfaces, provide greater injury potential due to
increased kinetic energies to be dissipated. Equivalent fall height' (EFH) is
conceptually simple and a familiar measure of impact danger used in safety
standards worldwide, from construction~\cite{OSHA2021} to children's playground
equipment~\cite{Chalmers1996}. EFHs of terrain park jumps can be calculated
using techniques in~\cite{McNeil2012} from Cartesian coordinates of jump
profiles. Profiles must include starting points, takeoff ramps, and landing
hills, along jumpers' paths. Controlling energy dissipation in human bodies,
hence EFH on jumps, is ethical engineering, reducing likelihoods and severities
of injuries. EFH should be a primary attribute of jumps' designs. It must be
considered because of clear connections to injuries risk and  can be used
easily to design and construct jumps.

Societal costs of jump injuries are discussed here with case studies that
illustrate dangers if EFH is not limited appropriately. We discuss papers
purporting to be ski safety research, which attempt to sow doubt about EFH
dangers, apparently for expert testimony by authors in defending industry in
personal injury lawsuits. Proposals for improved safety are absent. We  present
a user-friendly web application that facilitates jumping injury reduction by
calculating EFHs on current and future jumps.

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:hist}
%
Terrain park jumps are not new. Gradual introduction in the 1980's was
accompanied by increased interest in aerial maneuvers and extreme sports
participation.  Jumps have proliferated since and today are nearly ubiquitous.
Roughly 95\% of US ski resorts include terrain parks. Unfortunately, this
growth correlates with injuries. Two early longitudinal studies in the 1980's
and early 1990's~\cite{Deibert1998,Furrer1995} already found significant
increases in head injuries and concussions. Between 1993 and 1997 head injuries
accompanied most skiing and snowboarding deaths~\cite{CPSC1999}. Koehle et al.
\cite{Koehle2002} stated ``[S]eventy-seven percent of spinal
injuries~\cite{Tarazi1999} and 30\% of head injuries~\cite{Fukuda2001} in
snowboarding were a result of jumps.'' Jackson et al.~\cite{Jackson2004}
determined that by 2004 snow skiing replaced football as the second leading
cause of serious head and spinal cord injuries in America.

These early increasing injury assessments persisted. According to
\cite{Russell2014}, ``between 5\% and 27\% of skiing and snowboarding injuries
occur[red] in terrain parks
\cite{Bridges2003,Goulet2007,Moffat2009,Greve2009,Brooks2010,Ruedl2013}''.
Incredibly, at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games more than a third of all
snowboard half-pipe and slope-style competitors were injured~\cite{Ruedl2012}.
Epidemiological research~\cite{Carus2016,Audet2020,Hosaka2020} continues to
show that injuries on terrain park jumps are more likely and more severe than
on normal slopes. Audet et.~al~\cite{Audet2020} provides evidence that skiing
or snowboarding in a terrain park is a risk factor for head, neck, back, and
severe injuries. Hosaka et. al~\cite{Hosaka2020} concludes that jumping is a
main cause for serious spinal injuries, regardless of skill level, and suggests
that, because spinal injuries incidence  have not decreased over time,  the ski
industry should focus on designing fail-safe jump features to minimize risks of
serious spinal injuries. Similar suggestions appeared in peer-reviewed literature
for more than a
decade~\cite{Hubbard2009,Swedberg2012,McNeil2012,McNeil2012a,Hubbard2015,Levy2015,Petrone2017,Moore2018}.

\section{Equivalent Fall Height}
\label{sec:efh}
%
\emph{EFH}, a common proxy measure for impact danger in industrial safety
standards, is the weight-specific kinetic energy that must be dissipated on
impacts from a height $h$, is ~\cite{Hubbard2012}.  Initial potential energy given
by $mgh$ is transformed to kinetic energy available to injure on impact in
non-rotating falls. Injury potential can be reduced by controlling impact
circumstances, e.g.  impact cushioning, and body orientation, configuration,
and motion; however this energy must still be dissipated. Larger EFHs require
more elaborate measures to reduce injury; reducing EFH does not.

EFH can be interpreted by the general public. People have an intuitive danger
sense when faced with potential falls from large heights and a strong
experiential common sense for relating fall height to likelihood of injury.
People sense increasing danger associated with falling from larger heights.
Ground, second and third floor falls are about 2.6, 5.1,
8.8~\si{\meter}, respectively ~\cite{Vish2005}. The US Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, OSHA, requires protection for heights greater than
1.2~\si{\meter} for general workplace safety~\cite{OSHA2021}.  Chalmers et
al.~\cite{Chalmers1996} argues for 1.5~\si{\meter} maximum fall heights for
playground equipment. The Swiss Council for Accident Prevention makes specific
recommendations for EFHs to be below 1.5~\si{\meter} for jumps requiring basic
skills~\cite{Heer2019}. Even with no standards in Olympic Nordic ski jumps, typical 
``equivalent landing height``  ~\cite{Gasser2018} is about 0.5~\si{\meter}.

EFHs $h$ of objects is formally defined as
%
\begin{equation} h = \frac{v^2}{2g} \label{eq:efh_general} \end{equation}
%
where $v$ is impact velocity and $g$ is gravitational acceleration.
Kinetic energies of objects moving at  velocities $v$ at  is transformed from potential energies at heights $h$, indisputable, fundamental physics.

From equation~\ref{eq:efh_general} equivalent fall heights $h$ can be
determined for any surface, i.e., landing hill profile or shape, after jumping
~\cite{Petrone2017}. The result, neglecting air drag, is
%
\begin{equation}
  h = \left[\frac{x^2}{4(x\tan\theta_T - y)\cos^{2}\theta_T} -
    y\right]\sin^{2}\left[\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2y}{x}- \tan\theta_T\right) -
    \tan^{-1}\frac{dy}{dx}\right]
  \label{eq:efh}
\end{equation}

takeoff angles are $\theta_T$, impact coordinates $(x,y)$ are for landing
surfaces, and slopes of landing surfaces are $\frac{dy}{dx}$. This is not a
function of takeoff speed~\cite{Petrone2017}. Trajectories and hills can have
similar shapes, however with sufficient speed, hills could be out-jumped. To
analyze jumps, just measure Cartesian coordinates of landing surfaces along
jumpers' flight paths and takeoff angles. Slopes $\frac{dy}{dx}$ are computed
from measured coordinates $(x,y)$. Curvatures for the last two meters before
takeoffs must be near zero to avoid unintentional inversion, although this does
not influence EFHs.

\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}
%
In these American suits juries ruled for injured plaintiffs. Negligent  jump
design and construction contributed significantly to
injuries~\cite{SuperiorCourtSanGrancisco2002,KingCountySuperiorCourt2008}. Simulation follow from methods in
\cite{Levy2015}, assuming skier mass, frontal area, and drag coefficient of
75~\si{\kg}, 0.34~\si{\meter\squared}, and 0.821, respectively.

\subsection{Vine v. Bear Valley}
\label{sec:vine}
%
In April 2000, Ms.~Vine's lower spine was injured when she landed badly on a
jump at Bear Valley in California. The jump shape
(Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}) was a common form called a ``table-top''.
Builders intend that jumpers completely clear the table, landing on down-slopes
near a ``sweet spot''.  Vine landed short of the knuckle (the end of the
table-top). The upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley} shows the jump
surface from accident investigation measurements. This table-top, which would
typically be flat and horizontal, was instead concave, compounding dangers of
short landings. At the 11~\si{\meter} actual measured horizontal landing
distance from the takeoff point, the surface was sloped upwards approximately
5\si{\degree}. The concave shape emphasizes detrimental effects of not aligning
surface tangents closer to jumper flight paths at impact.
%
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=5.25in]{figures/vine-v-bear-valley.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Bear Valley jump compared to possible safer design}
  Top: Measured landing surface (solid black) and jumper flight paths
  (intermittent black) from measured 30\si{\degree} takeoff angle.
  14~\si{\meter\per\second} Takeoff speeds are used as design speeds \cite{Levy2015} for a
  comparison jump (solid green) shaped to have constant EFH of 1~\si{\meter}.
  Bottom: EFH for both jumps in corresponding
  colors at 2~\si{\meter} intervals. Numbers above bars indicate

  }
  \label{fig:vine-v-bear-valley}
\end{figure}

The lower panel displays EFH at different landing locations, which is greatest
just short of the knuckle.  At the ``sweet spot'' just past the knuckle the EFH
drops precipitously to  about 1~\si{\meter} but landing in this narrow region
requires jumpers to control takeoff speeds within 1~\si{\meter\per\second}.
Landing at 11 meters, Vine's EFH was almost 4 meters, equivalent to falling
from between one and two stories~\cite{Vish2005}. Vine had also rotated
backward in flight. She landed on her lower spine and was paralyzed. A lower
EFH would have decreased likelihood of injury, due to lower impact forces.

In contrast, landing surfaces designed to have smaller EFHs can be created at
similar cost. The green jump profile in the upper panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:vine-v-bear-valley} shows a possible jump design,
see~\cite{Levy2015}, of similar size with similar flight times that ensures a
constant (smaller) EFH of about 1~\si{\meter}. The convex shape of this jump is
interestingly close to the original concave table-top  inverted, showing that
convex landing shapes are critically important for controlling EFHs. This
alternative jump design would have lowered impact forces for landings at any
location. In 2002, the jury ruled in favor of Ms.~Vine, agreeing that Bear
Valley was responsible for designing safer jumps.

\subsection{Salvini v. Ski Lifts Inc.}
\label{sec:salvini}
%
In 2004, Mr.~Salvini attempted a table-top jump on skis in the terrain park of
The Summit at Snoqualmie Ski Resort, in Washington state. Salvini overshot the
intended landing location while traveling at typical skiing speeds, rotated
backward during flight and landed on his back, ultimately suffering
quadriplegia. At his landing location of 30~\si{\meter} the EFH was over 10
meters, approximately a 3-story fall.  Figure~\ref{fig:salvini-v-snoqualmie}
shows the jump profile based on measurements from the accident investigation.
For takeoff speeds greater than 13~\si{\meter\per\second}, the lower panel
shows that the EFH is greater than 10~\si{\meter} and grows linearly with
larger takeoff speeds. Severe injury is almost certain in falls this high,
especially if body orientation on landing loads the spine, as in this case.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5.25in]{figures/salvini-v-snoqualmie.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Snoqualmie jump compared to possible safer design}
  Top: Measured landing surface (solid black) and jumper flight paths
  (intermittent black) for measured 25\si{\degree} takeoff angle. The
  16~\si{\meter\per\second} takeoff speed is used as the design speed for a
  comparison jump (solid green) with constant equivalent fall height of
  1~\si{\meter}.
  Bottom: Equivalent fall height for both jumps in corresponding colors
  at 2~\si{\meter} intervals. Numbers above bars indicate takeoff speed
  required to land at that location.

  collapse, average 1st story fall, average 2nd story fall, and average 3rd
  story fall.
  }
  \label{fig:salvini-v-snoqualmie}
\end{figure}

The upper panel also shows a jump profile (green) designed to have a
1~\si{\meter} equivalent fall height for all speeds below
16~\si{\meter\per\second}. This profile requires significantly more snow than
the measured jump but alleviates dangerous impacts.

This jump highlights how extreme EFHs become if jumps are not properly
designed. Few recreational skiers will jump out three story windows, snow or
not. Injuries are clearly likely.  Our internal altimeter tells us so, but it's
not easy to discern when visually assessing a jump's shape.

These two case studies clearly show that deficient jump shapes have devastating
consequences and that engineering analysis and design, based on laws of
mechanics, can be used to shape jump landings that limit EFHs. Designing jumps
this way is based on the well-established, centuries-old mechanics of Newton
and Émilie du Châtelet~\cite{Zinsser2007}, fundamental to physics and
engineering education. Designing jumps to limit EFHs appropriately reduces
injury risks by reducing impact energies, absolutely.

\section{Moral Imperative}
\label{sec:moral}
%
``Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the
public''~\cite{NSPE2019}, is the first canon of engineering ethics. The moral
imperative of engineering ethics is motivating. The first canon compels
engineers to direct technical expertise to protecting snowsport participants
from injuries. No one can rationally argue that reducing EFH would increase
likelihoods of injuries. Building well designed, safe jumps is no more
laborious than building poorly designed, unsafe jumps. There is no reason not
to control EFHs with good design methods. Nonetheless skiing industries and
their insurance companies are reluctant to adopt and endorse such design
methods. They hire expert witnesses engineers to sow doubt on simple, basic
physics, while ignoring the first canon. This is unethical, bogus engineering.

Oreskes and Conway~\cite{Oreskes2010} have studied this problem more generally.
They showed that from time to time, scientific evidence accumulates that
commonly occurring industrial activities are harmful, either to individuals or
to society. Industries have a vested interest in continuing the status quo.
Operational changes  lead to significant, short-term costs. Examples of such
situations over the last 60 years carefully described and analyzed in
~\cite{Oreskes2010} are the use of DDT, smoking tobacco, acid rain linked to
coal-fired power plants, ozone holes caused by CFCs, second-hand tobacco
smoke’s effects, and CO2-caused climate change, among others. Rather than using
the proven science as a basis for changes in practice, strategic responses of
industries have been to “emphasize the controversy among scientists and the
need for continued research”~\cite{Oreskes2010}. This strategy is used by
snowsport defense experts. To counter solid, fundamental, scientific concepts
of landing hill design, limiting EFH, defense experts introduced confounding
factors to cloud and confuse basic issues.

%~\todo{Not sure this paragraph still should be included. It is relevant but maybe  distracting.} I think it is important.

American legal, healthcare and insurance systems corrupt technical literature
for legal defense of unsafe practices. Peer-reviewed technical literature is
used to support testimony in lawsuits. Both plaintiffs and defendants hire
experts to testify. Authors of technical papers testify. When it is for the
defense, it can result in denying compensation for injuries and prolong unsafe
practices. American healthcare systems can leave families of victims of
paralysis destitute with little recourse but suing snowsport resorts.  American
health insurance companies also sue resorts to recover their losses in injury
cases. Conflicts of interest go undeclared in papers and presentations, for
organizing and chairing meetings, and edit publications. Financial support for
publications gets routed through consulting companies. providing plausible
deniability of actual conflicts.

%\todo[inline]{Add paragraph here that squishes the next 3 paragraphs into 1. This paragraph should retain the ability for the readers to judge for themselves whether the science is bad and support our conjecture that the authors and ski industry are following the same patterns as these other industries (tobacco, etc.). We should tone down the explicit claims of unethical-ness.}

Consider three examples of papers co-authored by well-known skiing industry
defense experts who have testified for the snowsport resorts and their
insurance companies. Shealy et. al~\cite{Shealy2010} conducted an experimental
study which attempted to test the hypothesis that takeoff speed is a predictor
of the distance from a take-off to a jump landing. They reached the
mechanically preposterous conclusions both that there is ``no statistically
significant relationship between takeoff speed and the distance traveled'' and
that ``takeoff speed is not a dominant or controlling factor (in how far a
jumper travels)''. These conclusions were used to question the soundness of
analytical mechanical modeling used by ~\cite{Hubbard2009,McNeil2012}. In
contrast to voluminous research Shealy et. al~\cite{Shealy2015} claimed that
catastrophic and fatal injury rates at US snowsport resorts had not changed,
even though terrain parks and jumping had.

%They indicate that a series of jumpers who use a terrain park jump land within
%a narrow region, which is reasonable once it is noted that the jumpers'
%takeoff speeds did not vary much either, i.e. no attempt was made to assess a
%reasonable range of their independent variable, speed. The authors state the
%preposterous conclusions both that there is ``no statistically significant
%relationship between takeoff speed and the distance traveled'' and that
%``takeoff speed is not a dominant or controlling factor (in how far a jumper
%travels)''. These results should lead the careful researcher to question their
%experimental design and analysis methods, just as a high school physics
%student should if their an object in their lab experiment does not fall with
%an acceleration close to 9.8~\si{\meter\per\second\squared}.

%Shealy et. al~\cite{Shealy2015} claim that catastrophic and fatal injury rates
%at US snow resorts have not changed, even though terrain parks (and thus
%likely jumping) have increased over time. The statistical model in this study
%was expressly designed such that passage of time was used as the sole
%explanatory variable for incident rates. The authors do not report absolute
%numbers of fatalities and injuries, only incident rates, which provide a more
%favorable view for the ski industry and their risk assessment. No data is
%disclosed and they use unspecified weighting factors in order to harmonize
%data over time,leaving one to question what these weightings are. Data and
%robust modern statistical methods exist for testing their stated hypothesis.
%We can only speculate as to why those may have not been used for this
%analysis. Drawing their final conclusion, that addition of terrain parks
%mitigates risks, is quite a stretch, given the data and debatable analysis.
%When it comes to health and safety of the public, society is also interested
%in reducing or eliminating the absolute numbers.  This is especially true for
%activities in which the risk of catastrophic life-changing or fatal injuries
%can be mitigated by ethical engineering designs, and therefore are not be
%inherent to the sport.

In an article on landing positions, Scher et al. show that body orientation can
cause dangerous cervical spine loads~\cite{Scher2015}. They report on effects
od EFH but only test heights from \SIrange{0.23}{1.52}{\meter}, committing a
similar fault as \cite{Shealy2010}, restricting ranges of their independent
variables, and ignoring fall heights known to have caused severe injuries. Yet
purporting EFH has no appreciable effect on injures. The title is, ``Terrain
Park Jump Design: Would Limiting Equivalent Fall Height Reduce Spinal
Injuries?'' implies that they appear to believe that falling on one's head from
greater heights might \emph{not} cause greater injuries.  Why propose such
mechanically flawed hypotheses?

The first two studies do poor jobs isolating variables, and apparently were not
intended to. The third suffers from restriction of EFH range. None of these
papers are written with intending to reduce injuries. No suggestions are made
how their findings could be used to promote public. These attempt to obscure
mechanically irrefutable facts that impacting  surfaces at  lower velocities is
safer. Introducing bogus science is well known in American litigation, like in
defending tobacco~\cite{Oreskes2010}.

Poorly executed experiments in snowsports, no matter how expensive the
instrumentation, cannot disprove fundamental laws of mechanics. If statistics
or experimental results do seem in conflict with predictions from classical
mechanics, problems are with the statistical or experimental design or its
interpretation, not with fundamental laws of mechanics. Defending practices
that lead to injuries can prolong dangerous design practices, which can lead to
further injuries, clearly contradictory to engineering ethics. It is difficult
to get otherwise intellectually competent engineers to appreciate the damage
they are doing in their defense work.  As Upton Sinclair wrote "it is difficult
to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not
understanding it \cite{Sinclair1994}

In injury cases testifying for an injured plaintiff, and testifying to defend
insurance companies, are not ethical equivalents. One attempts to address
problems that cause injuries, holding paramount the safety health and welfare
of the public. The other attempts to defend practices that might have
contributed to the injury, in order to limit financial losses of insurance
companies. The proverbial two sides to every question is not valid in science
and engineering.

\section{What Can Be Done?}
\label{sec:action}
%
Societal needs should be addressed. Preventable injuries on terrain park jumps
should stop. Injured people require appropriate care that should not depend on
prolonged adversarial litigation clouded by bogus engineering. Papers that help
to perpetuate dangerous practices do not belong in engineering journals or
conferences.

Everything should be done to eliminate dangerous jumps.  Ski area operators and
their grooming staff must be educated and given tools. Standards are needed for
jump designs with limited EFHs, specifying verification, inspection, and
maintenance during use. Certification programs are needed for jump building,
inspecting, and maintenance.

Around 1980 ASTM F27 developed standards on ski binding adjustments. Proponents were led by orthopedic surgeons and academic researchers. Industry argued that release value measurement is impossible for ski shops. Industry is making similar arguments on jumps. There are now certifications and inspection standards for bindings, and far fewer lower extremity equipment related injuries. 

ASTM F27 is dominated by industry now. No medical professionals and almost no academics remain. Balance between consumers and industry is gone.  People self-classify general interest or users, yet testify for industry or do other industry related jobs and should be producers. 

Assessing and reshaping existing jumps for dangerous EFH should be an easy way
for ski resorts to reduce the danger of their terrain park jumps. Accurate
enough measurements of an existing slope can be taken with simple tools, e.g. a
tape measure and a digital level, and only takes a short amount of time per
jump, see Appendix~\ref{sec:jump-shape-measurement}.  Calculation and
visualization of EFHs  from these measurements can take some time without a
program for calculating EFHs from hill profiles. One is now available online
that is a freely accessible, and user friendly web application that makes the
calculation and visualization step almost instantaneous for jump builders. With
the tool described in the next section, jump builders can easily add this
safety assessment to their toolbox, even using it from a smartphone on hills.
There is no reason that this basic assessment should not be part of jump
construction processes. The only ethical decision is to adopt these methods;
saving even one person from a life of paralysis, or even death, must be worth
the relatively minor inconvenience of shaping jumps using the rules in
\cite{Levy2015}.

\subsection{Software and Online Access}
\label{sec:software}
%
We presented the first version of software for designing ski jumps with a
constant equivalent fall height in \cite{Moore2018}. The software comprises of
a general purpose, extensible, object oriented software library with tools for
2D skiing simulation. Using the library code, a web application was developed
for interactive jump design. The web application is designed for a
non-technical end user and usable on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device; any
device that supports a web browser.

We have extended the capabilities of the software in version 1.4.0, released
alongside this publication, for the purposes of the work described in this
paper. New library features were added that automate the calculation of
equivalent fall height for jump profiles described by a series of Cartesian
coordinates. Additionally, a new ``analysis'' page was added to the web
application which allows users to upload either a comma separated value CSV
text file or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file with the measured jump profile
coordinates. The jump is then analyzed and the equivalent fall height is
displayed graphically for interactive user manipulation and viewing.
Figure~\ref{fig:web-app-screenshot} shows the web application with one of the
case study jumps loaded for analysis and explains the primary features.

    button [6], views the results in the interactive plot [2], and downloads
    the results by pressing the ``Download EFH'' button [7].}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
%
There are, of course, more factors than jump landing surface shape that
contribute to injuries on terrain park jumps. Impact velocity can be easily
controlled with a designed landing surface. There is no evidence to support
that decreasing EFH increases injuries in falls,  injuries can only decrease.
Thus there is no reason not to adopt constant EFH of low values for public use
jump designs.  Common sense is really all that is needed to believe that
falling from higher heights will increase injuries regardless of other factors.
Any person that must fall would surely choose to do so from the lowest height.
Constructors of jumps that are not designed with these facts in mind are
negligent. The safety, health, and welfare of the public involved in this sport
should be held paramount.

\section{Example software library use}
\label{sec:example}

%
The closed form equation~\ref{eq:efh} is useful for understanding the
fundamental relationship of equivalent fall height to the landing surface and
well predict these values for small jumps but other factors may be useful to
include in the model. For example, jumpers are subject to aerodynamic drag and
this is not negligible for larger jumps. If drag is included there is no closed
form solution for the equivalent fall height, but the equivalent fall height
can be computed through iterative simulation~\cite{Levy2015}. The jumper's
flight path is found by integrating the flight equations of motion at various
takeoff velocities and computing the misalignment in jumper landing angle and
the slope angle to then find the equivalent fall height. This more general
simulation method is implemented in the software described herein and the
results reflect the inclusion of gravitational and drag forces. The simulations
require measurements of the landing surface cross-sectional profile coordinates
$(x,y)$ relative to the takeoff point and a measurement of the takeoff angle.

Listing~\ref{lis:example-efh-calc} demonstrates creating a surface from some
measured data points and then calculating the equivalent fall height at
0.2\si{\meter} increments.

\section{Jump Shape Measurement}
\label{sec:jump-shape-measurement}
%
Calculating equivalent fall height requires the Cartesian coordinates and slope
of the landing surface along the path of the jumper. There are a number of
possible measurement techniques for collecting data adequate for the equivalent
fall height calculation but the simplest method only requires a digital level
\footnote{smartphone level measurement applications are likely sufficient and
readily available}, a flexible tape measure, and less than an hour's time from
one person per jump. A tenth of a degree accuracy from the level and down to 25
centimeter accuracy from the tape measure should be sufficient for typical snow
sport jumps.

To measure the jump, the takeoff point should be identified and the tape
measure should then be draped over the contour of the landing surface along the
projection of the expected flight path onto the landing surface. The origin of
the tape measure should be aligned with the takeoff point. Starting with the
takeoff point, the digital level should be used to record the absolute angle at
regular increments along the tape. The increment can be varied between
25~\si{\centi\meter} and 100~\si{\centi\meter}, with the former used for steep
slope changes and the later for less steep; 50~\si{\centi\meter} increments are
appropriate for average jump shapes. Positive angles should be recorded for
positive slope and negative angles for negative slope. The tabulated data
should include the distance along the surface from the takeoff point, $d_i$,
and the associated surface angle, $\theta_i$, at each distance measurement for
$n$ measurements. Assuming $\theta_i$ is in radians, the Cartesian coordinates
can be computed using the average angle to find the adjacent coordinates. The
following equations show provide the necessary data for the calculation of
equivalent fall height:
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{dy}{dx}_{i} & = \arctan{\theta_i} \\
  x_{i + 1} & =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{for } i=0 \\
    x_i + (d_{i+1} - d_i)\cos{(\theta_{i+1} + \theta_i)/2} &  \text{for } i=1\ldots n
  \end{cases} \\
  y_{i + 1} & =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{for } i=0 \\
    y_i + (d_{i+1} - d_i)\sin{(\theta_{i+1} + \theta_i)/2} &  \text{for } i=1\ldots n
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

Listing~\ref{lis:example-meas-calc} demonstrates calculating the landing
surface's Cartesian coordinates from measured distance and angle data collected
with the method described above.
