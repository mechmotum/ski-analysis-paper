  abstract = {Objectives The primary objective of this paper is to examine terrain park (TP) feature compliance with recommendations from a ski area industry guide (are TP features compliant with the guide?) and determine factors that could be associated with TP feature compliance in Qu\'ebec ski areas (do factors influence TP feature compliance?), Canada. These recommendations on the design, construction and maintenance are provided by the Qu\'ebec Ski Areas Association Guide. Methods A group of two to four trained research assistants visited seven ski areas. They used an evaluation tool to assess the compliance of 59 TP features. The evaluation tool, originally developed to assess the quality of TP features based on the guide, was validated in a previous study. Compliance was calculated by the percentage of compliant measures within a given feature. The potential influence of four factors on compliance (size of the TP, size of the feature, snow conditions and type of feature) were examined using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results The average TP feature compliance percentage was 93\% (95\% CI 88\% to 99\%) for boxes, 91\% (95\% CI 89\% to 94\%) for rails and 89\% (95\% CI 86\% to 92\%) for jumps. The logistic regression showed that none of the four factors examined were associated with TP feature compliance with the guide. Conclusion Our results suggest that TP features are highly compliant with the guide in Qu\'ebec ski areas.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite the widespread promotion of safety standards no epidemiological studies have adequately evaluated their effectiveness in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the height and surfacing requirements of the New Zealand standard for playgrounds and playground equipment. SETTING: Early childhood education centres and schools in two major cities in the South Island of New Zealand. METHODS: Data were collected on 300 children aged 14 years or less who had fallen from playground equipment. Of these, 110 (cases) had sustained injury and received medical attention, while 190 (controls) had not sustained injury requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Logistic regression models fitted to the data indicated that the risk of injury being sustained in a fall was increased if the equipment failed to comply with the maximum fall height (odds ratio (OR) = 3.0; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 13.1), surfacing (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI 1.0 to 5.0), or safe fall height (OR = 2.1; 95\% CI 1.1 to 4.0) requirements. Falls from heights in excess of 1.5 metres increased the risk of injury 4.1 times that of falls from 1.5 metres or less and it was estimated that a 45\% reduction in children attending emergency departments could be achieved if the maximum fall height was lowered to 1.5 metres. CONCLUSIONS: Although the height and surfacing requirements of the New Zealand standard are effective in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment, consideration should be given to lowering the maximum permissible fall height to 1.5 metres.},

  abstract = {Background Competitive skiers face a high risk of sustaining an ACL injury during jump landing in downhill skiing. There is a lack of knowledge on how landing height affects this risk. Objectives To evaluate the effect of varied landing height on peak ACL force during jump landing and to compare the effect of the landing height with the effect of the landing position varied by the trunk lean of the skier. Methods A 25-degree-of-freedom sagittal plane musculoskeletal model of an alpine skier, accompanied by a dynamic optimisation framework, was used to simulate jump landing manoeuvres in downhill skiing. First, a reference simulation was computed tracking experimental data of competitive downhill skier performing a jump landing manoeuvre. Second, sensitivity studies were performed computing 441 landing manoeuvres with perturbed landing height and trunk lean of the skier, and the corresponding effects on peak ACL force were determined. Results The sensitivity studies revealed that peak ACL force increased with jump height and backward lean of the skier as expected. However, peak ACL was about eight times more sensitive to the trunk lean of the skier compared with landing height. The decreased sensitivity of the landing height was based on the lower effects on the knee muscle forces and the shear component of the knee joint reaction force. Conclusion Preventive measures are suggested to focus primarily on avoiding trunk backward lean of the skier, and consequently on proper jump preparation and technique, and secondarily on strategies to reduce landing height during jumps.},

In the construction industry, falls are the most frequently occurring types of accidents resulting in fatalities. The purpose of the study was to identify the root causes of fall accidents and to identify any additional information that might be helpful in reducing the incidence of construction worker falls in the future. While data from January 1990 through October 2001 were examined, particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents that occurred in the last 5 years of this time interval, a period when more data were accumulated and coded in the OSHA investigation reports. Results show that most fall accidents take place at elevations of less than 9.15 m Õë30 ftÕí, occurring primarily on new construction projects of commercial buildings and residential projects of relatively low construction cost. Furthermore, experience does not seem to diminish accident occurrence; hazards are often misjudged by workers; and various other patterns can also be observed. Most alarming, the results show that fall accidents account for a growing proportion of the total number of construction worker fatalities.},

The model consists of skis, legs, torso and head, and arms. Inputs include net joint torques that are used to vary the relative body configurations of the jumper during flight. The model also relies on aerodynamic data from previous wind tunnel tests that incorporate the effects of varying body configuration and orientation on lift, drag, and pitching moment. A symbolic manipulation program, ``Macsyma,'' is used to derive the equations of motion automatically. Experimental body segment orientation data during the flight phase are presented for three ski jumpers which show how jumpers of varying ability differ in flight and demonstrate the need for a more complex analytical model than that previously presented in the literature. Simulations are presented that qualitatively match the measured trajectory for a good jumper. The model can be used as a basis for the study of optimal jumper behavior in flight which maximizes jump distance.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It has also been shown that the severity of impact risk can be characterized by equivalent fall height (EFH), a measure of jumper impact velocity normal to the slope, and that design algorithms exist to calculate landing-surface shapes that limit EFH to arbitrarily low values. Although proposals have been made recently to introduce design, the skiing industry and other authors have objected that analysis, design, and standards are impossible because of various ``uncontrollable'' factors that allegedly make the problem intractable to analytical design techniques. We consider the list of uncontrollable factors one by one and show that, to the contrary, each is either: (1) irrelevant to design, (2) has negligible effect, if any, on designed EFH, or (3) can be directly incorporated into the design process.},

In a first step to provide a proof-of-principle example, we designed and built a novel constant equivalent fall height (EFH) snow park jump at the Tognola Ski Resort in San Martino di Castrozza, Italy. The impact performance of this jump and that of an existing standard tabletop jump were measured using a jumper on a snowboard instrumented with accelerometers. Using only the accelerometer channel perpendicular to the snowboard plane, we were able to estimate the velocity changes at impact perpendicular to the landing surface, the corresponding EFH, and approximate values of the energy absorbed on impact. These were found to be in rough agreement with the theoretical expectations for EFH derived from the measured jump profiles, including trends for the tabletop jump EFH as a function of distance jumped that have been described in the literature.},

This paper provides a natural rationale for selection of the least expensive (minimum snow budget) one of these that nevertheless satisfies other design constraints, mainly limited normal acceleration and jerk during approach and landing transitions. Choosing the maximum allowable normal acceleration during the approach transition brings the entire infinite family of landing surfaces as close as possible to the parent slope. Limiting the rate of change of normal acceleration (jerk) decreases the likelihood of loss of balance at takeoff and consequent catastrophic spinal cord injuries on landing. An analogous choice, satisfying limited normal acceleration during the landing transition, selects the single member of the infinite family (providing the desired EFH) that lies closest to the parent slope and is therefore least costly to build. Software in the form of a graphical user interface is described that implements these algorithms and is appropriate for inexperienced users to calculate design details before actual fabrication of landing surfaces at a specific jump site.},

One especially hazardous situation is when the jumper lands in an inverted position which can lead to catastrophic injury or death from spinal cord trauma. Whereas jumpers can execute inverted maneuvers intentionally, curvature in the takeoff can lead to involuntary inversion. In this work we lay out the basic physics of this phenomenon assuming a rigid body model which simulates a stiff-legged jumper. Included is an estimate of the partially compensating (forward) rotation caused by the ground reaction force. I apply the results to an actual jump having a curved takeoff. For a jump trajectory with a landing just past the ``knuckle,'' the resulting net angle of inverting rotation is found to be about 60 , sufficiently large to pose a potential injury risk. A mitigating takeoff design criterion adopted by the U.S. Terrain Park Council based on human response times is also discussed and compared to the FIS standard for Nordic jumps.},

  abstract = {Introduction Trampolines are responsible for specific injuries. We examined the severity of these injuries in children compared with those occurring in other activities. Our primary goal was to compare the injury severity between trampolining and other activities. Our secondary goal was to evaluate risk factors for severity in order to establish preventative measures and, third, to evaluate the increased prevalence of these injuries in our hospital from 2008 to 2016. Material and methods Our study was a retrospective, comparative, descriptive, and epidemiological research. Children aged 2\textendash 15 years admitted to our traumatology emergency services between June and October 2016 were included in the study. Non-sport-related injuries were excluded. Serious injuries were classified as fractures and admissions to the operating room. Results In total, 1106 children were admitted including 107 trampoline accidents. The fracture rate was similar in the two groups: 34 (31.78\%) vs. 309 (30.93\%), OR=1.039, 95\% CI [0.65, 1.62] P=0.91. Surgical treatments were more frequent in the trampoline group: 4 (3.74\%) vs. 18 (1.80\%) OR=2.114, 95\% CI [0.51, 6.58] P=0.156. Several people jumping simultaneously on the trampoline was a risk factor (OR=1.56, 95\% CI [1.0908, 2.308], P=0.018). Parental supervision was a protective factor (OR=0.271, 95\% CI [0.08, 0.80], P=0.023). Trampolining accidents were 9.7 times more common in our center in 2016 compared with 2008. Discussion To our knowledge, no study has compared trampoline injuries with those stemming from other activities. Awareness campaigns are needed as well as information from sellers, who have to be trained. Conclusion Surgical treatments are twice as likely in trampoline accidents. Prevention is simple: Children should be alone on the trampoline and supervised by an adult.},

  abstract = {The use of muscles as power dissipators is investigated in this study, both from the modellistic and the experimental points of view. Theoretical predictions of the drop landing manoeuvre for a range of initial conditions have been obtained by accounting for the mechanical characteristics of knee extensor muscles, the limb geometry and assuming maximum neural activation. Resulting dynamics have been represented in the phase plane (vertical displacement versus speed) to better classify the damping performance. Predictions of safe landing in sedentary subjects were associated to dropping from a maximum (feet) height of 1.6-2.0 m (about 11 m on the moon). Athletes can extend up to 2.6-3.0 m, while for obese males (m = 100 kg, standard stature) the limit should reduce to 0.9-1.3 m. These results have been calculated by including in the model the estimated stiffness of the `global elastic elements' acting below the squat position. Experimental landings from a height of 0.4, 0.7, 1.1 m (sedentary males (SM) and male (AM) and female (AF) athletes from the alpine ski national team) showed dynamics similar to the model predictions. While the peak power (for a drop height of about 0.7 m) was similar in SM and AF (AM shows a + 40\% increase, about 33 W/kg), AF stopped the downward movement after a time interval (0.219{$\pm$}0.030 s) from touch-down 20\% significantly shorter than SM. Landing strategy and the effect of anatomical constraints are discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Skiing and snowboarding have become more acrobatic with terrain park jumps and other manmade features playing a prominent role in an increase in serious spinal cord injuries. Yet these jumps rarely, if ever, involve formal or detailed design or engineering. This paper presents a coherent theory and methodology for the design of ski jump landing surfaces. The motion of the skier center of mass is modeled. Although jumpers may land in many configurations, we assume that the probability of severe landing injury is correlated with the component of skier velocity perpendicular ÕënormalÕí to the landing surface v\cyrchar{\'\CYRK} or, more understandably, with the corresponding equivalent fall height ÕëEFHÕí. The requirement that v\cyrchar{\'\CYRK} and EFH be small is satisfied by making the landing surface nearly parallel to the skier flight path at landing. Safer landing surfaces that limit EFH to a given value are shown to satisfy a first order ordinary differential equation ÕëODEÕí. Having chosen an EFH deemed safe enough by the designer, integration of this ODE provides members of an infinite family of landing surfaces that limit the EFH to the desired value, for any jumper in-run velocity. Using the takeoff ramp angle as another design variable, one can choose a member of this family to fit on almost any available jump site. The formulation incorporates the fact that skiers can slightly modify velocity direction and magnitude at takeoff by jumping and is valid for any landing body configuration. Such landing surfaces can still yield exhilarating flight experiences with relatively large flight times and air height above the surface, but without the danger posed by jumps created in an ad hoc manner, which can expose the skier to much larger unsafe equivalent fall heights.},

  abstract = {Background. Skiing and snowboarding are popular competitive and recreational sports with associated head injury risks from impact hazards. Understanding head injury hazards and risks in snow sports can inform injury prevention measures, such as helmets, education and environment design of runs and terrain park features, to manage injury risk. Aim. To identify and discuss (a) the proportion and incidence of head injuries and effectiveness of helmets, (b) circumstances, situational events and characteristics of head injuries and (c) head impact biomechanics in recreational skiing and snowboarding. Methods. A narrative literature review was performed. Results. Head injuries comprise up to 38\% and 29\% of all injuries in skiing and snowboarding, respectively. Skull fractures were found to comprise nearly half of all moderate to severe head injuries in alpine sports across all studies. The most common intracranial injury in skiing and snowboarding was cerebral contusion and subdural haematoma, respectively. Fatal head injuries in skiing are rare with an incidence of approximately one death per one million skier-visits and less than 1\% of all skiing head injuries resulted in death. The majority of head injuries were sustained by novice and intermediate level skiers and snowboarders during falls on mild or moderate gradient slopes. Head injury cases occurred in terrain parks were more common in snowboarders than skiers. Fall-related head injuries to skiers are typically in the forward direction with an impact to the front of the head, whereas snowboarders fall rearward and impact the occipital region. Helmet use has increased in recent years, but recent studies have observed an unexpected reduction of the protective effect of helmets in skiing and snowboarding. Alpine sports helmet standards require linear drops onto rigid anvils, but the correlation with snow surfaces is unknown and no helmet standard requires an oblique impact test. Significant protective effects of helmets have been found for collisions and falls onto hard snow. Conclusions. Alpine sport helmet performance standards should more closely reflect the boundary conditions of impacts to skiers and snowboarders associated with head injury. Administrative and engineering controls may also reduce the risk of head injury in skiing and snowboarding.},

It improves on the previous efforts with more complete instrumentation, a larger range of jump distances, and a new method for combining jumper- and board-mounted accelerometer data to estimate equivalent fall height, a measure of impact severity.

  abstract = {The performance of individuals jumping tabletop features in terrain parks has not been widely studied. A field study was conducted to measure the takeoff speed and horizontal distance achieved by jumpers at two tabletop style jump features: A smaller jump at Snow Summit, CA and a larger jump at Mammoth Mountain, CA, USA. Analyses were also conducted to determine the effects of equipment type Õëskis versus snowboardÕí on jumper kinematics. Before each data collection session, the physical dimensions of the jump were measured and recorded. For consecutive jumpers, the speed parallel to the ramp was measured at the end of the takeoff by using a laser speed trap accurate to 0.11 m/s. The landing zone was marked at 3.0 m intervals with colored dye, beginning just past the flat deck portion of the jump. A high-definition video camera was used to record the landing of each jumper, and the landing point of the projected center of mass was determined by using photogrammetry, accurate to within 5 cm. The actual landing distances measured in the field were compared to predicted landing distances by using ordinary ballistic equations. A total of 280 jumps was observed on the two features: 105 on skis and 175 on snowboards. The correlation coefficients between the square of the takeoff speed and the landing distance for the smaller and larger jumps were 0.75 ÕëR2œ≠0.56Õí and 0.41 ÕëR2œ≠0.16Õí, respectively. The measured landing distances differed significantly from those predicted by models using the ballistic equations of motion. The average landing distance beyond the knuckle was 2.4 m on the smaller jump and 2.1 m on the larger jump. For both features, skier and snowboarder jumpers did not differ in average landing distance.},

  abstract = {Terrain park tabletop jumps have a shape that is common at many ski areas today. A safe, low-impact landing on any jump with a constant linear landing area requires that the component of jumper velocity perpendicular to the landing surface be small, and when velocities are large, achieving this requires that the jumper flight path angle be nearly equal to the landing surface angle. Landing impact severity can alternatively be measured using the equivalent fall height (EFH). Based on Newton's laws and assumed ballistic flight, this research presents a general expression for the EFH experienced by a jumper when landing at any possible point on any landing surface whatsoever. This general expression is then particularized to show the effects on the EFH of the four physical features of a generic tabletop jump with a flat, horizontal deck and a constant linear landing region: the takeoff angle h0, the coordinates of the knuckle xt and yt where the intended constant-slope landing region begins, and the snow landing surface angle u in this region. Numerical results show that tabletop jump EFHs have increasing and possibly large values near the ends of both the tabletop and the linear landing downslope portions. We conclude that tabletop jumps do not exhibit a low impulse on landing everywhere, which increases the likelihood of jumper injuries relative to those jumps for which the EFH is small everywhere.},

Objective: To describe the housing characteristics and types of injuries among children who fell from windows treated in a Chicago pediatric trauma center. Methods: Children treated in a pediatric trauma center for injuries related to window falls between 1995 and 2002 were identified retrospectively. We reviewed family demographics, the circumstances of the fall, and types of injuries. Site visits were performed to determine the height and type of building and type of window where the fall took place. Results: The authors reviewed 90 cases; 55 were male. The median age was 2 years. Ninety eight percent of falls were reported to be from the third floor or lower. Site visits (n = 77) showed that 96\% of the buildings were four storeys or lower. The median length of hospital stay was two days (range 0\textendash 24 days). The most common injuries were head trauma and extremity fractures. Three patients died, and an additional three patients were discharged to rehabilitation centers. Conclusions: Some window falls result in serious injury. In Chicago, most falls were from modest heights (2nd/3rd floor windows) in buildings of four or fewer storeys, rather than from ``high rises''. Strategies to prevent window falls should be directed to the owners and occupants of this type of housing.},
