  abstract = {Objective To synthesise the current evidence regarding the risk factors, the injury prevention strategies and the profile of injured skiers and snowboarders in terrain parks (TPs) and half-pipes (HPs). Design Systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Data sources Literature searches from six electronic databases and manual searches were performed. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion criteria were: (1) publication based on original data; (2) injuries sustained in TPs or HPs; (3) recreational skiing or snowboarding injuries; (4) observational or experimental study design with a comparison group. Results No study explored the risk factors in HPs or the prevention strategies in TPs or HPs. From the literature retrieved, there is strong evidence that skiing or snowboarding in a TP is a risk factor for head, neck, back and severe injuries. Two papers assessed the risk factors for injuries in TPs, mainly demonstrating that features promoting aerial manoeuvres or a large drop to the ground were associated with higher feature-specific injury rates. The profile of injured skiers and snowboarders in TPs described in the literature suggested some evidence of associations between factors including activity, sex, skill level, helmet use, age and TP injuries. Summary/conclusions This systematic review demonstrates the need for studies identifying the risk factors for injuries to skiers and snowboarders and on interventions to reduce the risk of injury in TPs and HPs. Studies addressing the issue of TP design should be considered. PROSPERO registration number CRD42016045206.},

  abstract = {Objectives The primary objective of this paper is to examine terrain park (TP) feature compliance with recommendations from a ski area industry guide (are TP features compliant with the guide?) and determine factors that could be associated with TP feature compliance in Qu\'ebec ski areas (do factors influence TP feature compliance?), Canada. These recommendations on the design, construction and maintenance are provided by the Qu\'ebec Ski Areas Association Guide. Methods A group of two to four trained research assistants visited seven ski areas. They used an evaluation tool to assess the compliance of 59 TP features. The evaluation tool, originally developed to assess the quality of TP features based on the guide, was validated in a previous study. Compliance was calculated by the percentage of compliant measures within a given feature. The potential influence of four factors on compliance (size of the TP, size of the feature, snow conditions and type of feature) were examined using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results The average TP feature compliance percentage was 93\% (95\% CI 88\% to 99\%) for boxes, 91\% (95\% CI 89\% to 94\%) for rails and 89\% (95\% CI 86\% to 92\%) for jumps. The logistic regression showed that none of the four factors examined were associated with TP feature compliance with the guide. Conclusion Our results suggest that TP features are highly compliant with the guide in Qu\'ebec ski areas.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate injury patterns of snowbladers and compare them with those of skiers and snowboarders. To determine possible effects of helmet use in these sports on injury to the head and neck. Methods: This prospective case series observational study was conducted by collecting the injury reports from the ski patrol during the 1999\textendash 2000 season at Mont Tremblant ski resort, Quebec. All participants in downhill winter sports who presented themselves to the ski patrol with traumatic injury related to their sport were included. A concussion was defined as any loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, disorientation, vertigo, or headache that resulted from injury. The ski patroller reported helmet use on the accident report at the time of injury. Results: Snowbladers present with a unique pattern of injury compared with skiers and snowboarders. The incidence of leg, knee, and ankle/foot injuries were 20.5\%, 25.6\%, and 10.3\% respectively. Concussions represented 11\% of all injuries. There was no increase in other injury, including neck injury, related to helmet use. Conclusions: Unique injury patterns in snowbladers warrant reconsideration of equipment design. Concussion is a common injury on the ski slope. Although the effects of helmet use on concussion rate are inconclusive based on this study, helmet use did not increase the rate of neck injury, even when adjusted for age.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that snow park (SP) injuries are proportionally more frequent and more likely to be more severe than those sustained on traditional slopes. The aim of this study was to calculate skiers' overall and feature-specific injury rates and determine potential risk factors for severe injury in an SP. This is a retrospective study conducted during the 2013/2014 winter season in the SP of a major winter resort located in the Spanish Pyrenees. Cases were skiers who suffered feature-related injuries in the SP. Denominator data consisted of the estimated total number of skier runs and the estimated total number of times each feature was used by a skier. Injury rates were calculated and logistic regression used to determine the feature-specific odds of injury. A total of 113 cases met the inclusion criteria. The overall injury rate was of 0.9 per 1000 skier runs. Rates of injury were highest for Big jumps (2.9/1000 uses) and lowest for Rainbow boxes (0.1/1000 uses). Compared with Boxes, there were increased odds of severe injury versus minor injury for C-rails (OR 9.1; 95\% CI 0.6\textendash 13.18), Half-pipe (OR 4.5; 95\% CI 0.3\textendash 6.27) and Big jumps (OR 3.0; 95\% CI 0.3\textendash 3.53). Higher feature-specific ski injury rates and increased odds of injury were associated with features that require a very clean technique or promote aerial maneuvers and result in a larger drop to the ground.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite the widespread promotion of safety standards no epidemiological studies have adequately evaluated their effectiveness in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the height and surfacing requirements of the New Zealand standard for playgrounds and playground equipment. SETTING: Early childhood education centres and schools in two major cities in the South Island of New Zealand. METHODS: Data were collected on 300 children aged 14 years or less who had fallen from playground equipment. Of these, 110 (cases) had sustained injury and received medical attention, while 190 (controls) had not sustained injury requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Logistic regression models fitted to the data indicated that the risk of injury being sustained in a fall was increased if the equipment failed to comply with the maximum fall height (odds ratio (OR) = 3.0; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 13.1), surfacing (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI 1.0 to 5.0), or safe fall height (OR = 2.1; 95\% CI 1.1 to 4.0) requirements. Falls from heights in excess of 1.5 metres increased the risk of injury 4.1 times that of falls from 1.5 metres or less and it was estimated that a 45\% reduction in children attending emergency departments could be achieved if the maximum fall height was lowered to 1.5 metres. CONCLUSIONS: Although the height and surfacing requirements of the New Zealand standard are effective in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment, consideration should be given to lowering the maximum permissible fall height to 1.5 metres.},

The purpose of the current study was to document the overall rates of injury in children, adolescents, and adults participating in alpine skiing. We also sought to determine the ten most common injuries in each age-group. Finally, we analyzed short-term and long-term trends to determine if changes in equipment had had an effect on the frequency or pattern of injury.From the 1981\textendash 1982 to the 1993\textendash 1994 season, there were 2.79 injuries per 1000 skier days: 4.27 injuries in children, 2.93 in adolescents, and 2.69 in adults. During the last eight years of the study, the most common injuries were a contusion of the knee in children, a sprain of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb in adolescents, and a grade-III sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament in adults. The short-term trends revealed that, in children, the frequency of tibial fractures decreased 10 per cent while that of fractures of the upper extremity increased 8 per cent. The long-term trends showed that, in adults, the rate of tibial fractures decreased 89 per cent while that of injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament increased 280 per cent. The overall rate of injury decreased 43 per cent from the beginning of the study in 1972 to the end of the study in 1994; the decrease was 58 per cent in children, 45 per cent in adolescents, and 42 per cent in adults.Data on the types of equipment and the binding-release values were collected prospectively from injured skiers and from 2083 non-injured skiers. Of the fifty-nine skiers who sustained a spiral fracture of the tibia, forty-two (71 per cent) had binding-release values that were higher than the average for the uninjured group. We believe that the use of properly functioning modern equipment will decrease the rate of injury, particularly in children.},

There were 634 snowboarding-related head injuries and 442 skiing-related head injuries. The number of snowboarding head injuries increased rapidly over the study period. More male snowboarders than female snowboarders suffered head injuries. For both snowboarders and skiers, head injuries frequently occurred on the easy and middle slopes. Falls were the most frequent causes of injury in both groups. Jumping was a more frequent cause of injury in the snowboarders (30\%) than in the skiers (2.5\%). Injury to the occipital region predominated in the snowboarders as compared with the skiers. There were 49 organic lesions in 37 snowboarders and 46 organic lesions in 33 skiers. Subdural hematoma was frequent in the snowboarding head injury group, and fracture was frequent in the skiing head injury group compared with the snowboarding group (not significant). Subdural hematoma was likely to be caused by a fall rather than by a collision, and bone fracture was likely to be caused by a collision rather than by a fall. Four snowboarders and one skier died as a result of their head injuries. Our data suggest that snowboarding head injuries may be prevented by protection of the occipital region and refraining from jumping by beginners.},

Six skiers were caught on the ski run by an avalanche. Comparing the two time periods, trauma circumstances did not change significantly. The number of most severe head injuries (AIS score greater than or equal to4) increased from 11.6 to 19.3\% (p {$<$} 0.05). The overall mortality increased from 2 to 7\% (p {$<$} 0.05).

  abstract = {Background Evidence indicates that snow-park (SP) injuries are more severe than injuries on regular slopes. This prompted two major ski areas in the province of Qu\'ebec, Canada, to remove all man-made jumps from their SPs before the 2007\textendash 2008 season. Objective To determine if removing jumps from SPs reduced the prevalence of severe injuries for skiers and snowboarders. Methods Subjects were skiers and snowboarders who reported to the ski patrol with a SP injury at two ski areas before (seasons 2000\textendash 2001 to 2006\textendash 2007) and after (seasons 2007\textendash 2008 to 2009\textendash 2010) SP jumps were removed, and for all the ski areas with no SP jump removal. Severe injuries were defined based on type of injury or ambulance evacuation. We compared the proportion of severe injuries before and after SP jump removal with trends at the other areas. Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust the pre- and post change comparison for age, sex, skill level, helmet use, and type of activity. Results At the two hills that removed jumps, the proportion of severe injuries was 19.3\% (600 severe SP injuries/3109 all SP injuries) before and 14.5\% (63/434) after the change compared with 23.7\% (2679/11 324) and 22.1\% (921/4173) at other hills. After covariate adjustment, the odds of severe injuries declined at the two areas that removed jumps (adjusted OR (AOR): 0.72; 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.97) with no change at other Qu\'ebec ski areas (AOR 0.98; 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.08). Significance Results suggest that removing man-made jumps from SPs prevents severe injuries.},

  abstract = {Objective To explore the use of helmets in skiers and snowboarders injured at ski runs and terrain parks in Colorado and the northeast United States and to examine differences in head injury severity in terrain parks as compared to ski runs. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. We reviewed emergency department medical records of injured skiers at 9 medical facilities in Colorado, New York, and Vermont to examine the frequency of helmet use, type of terrain on which injuries occurred, and effect of injury event type and helmet use on change in mental status. Injuries that occurred from July 2002 to July 2004 were included. Eligible patients were skiers and snowboarders who sustained a head injury as defined by International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for acute head injuries. Data elements included event location, mechanism of injury, helmet use, loss of consciousness, neurologic findings, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and initial outcome. Data were entered into SPSS for analysis. Results Of 1013 patients, 52.6\% were skiing, 46.7\% were snowboarding, and the remainder engaged in other activities such as sledding or using a sit ski. Most (78.7\%) were using a ski run, whereas 19.1\% were at a terrain park when their injuries occurred, and 37.1\% were wearing helmets. Most injuries (74.1\%) occurred when the victim hit his/her head on the snow; 10.0\% and 13.1\% occurred in collisions with other skiers and fixed objects, respectively. There were significantly fewer instances of loss of consciousness in fall events in the Colorado group ({$\chi$}2: 4.127; P{$<$}.05), a significantly lower incidence of loss of consciousness in helmet users who struck a fixed object ({$\chi$}2: 5.800; P{$<$}.05), and a significantly higher incidence of skiers colliding with fixed objects in the Northeast ({$\chi$}2: 14.05; P{$<$}.005). There were significantly more documented head injuries in terrain parks, even when controlling for helmet use ({$\chi$}2: 5.800; P{$<$}.05). Conclusion There is an increased risk of head injury, regardless of helmet use, at terrain parks as compared to ski runs, and helmets were notably protective in collisions with fixed objects. Regional differences in injury events were noted in that there were more fall-related head injuries and a higher incidence of collisions with fixed objects in the Northeast compared to Colorado.},

Objectives To evaluate the effect of varied landing height on peak ACL force during jump landing and to compare the effect of the landing height with the effect of the landing position varied by the trunk lean of the skier. Methods A 25-degree-of-freedom sagittal plane musculoskeletal model of an alpine skier, accompanied by a dynamic optimisation framework, was used to simulate jump landing manoeuvres in downhill skiing. First, a reference simulation was computed tracking experimental data of competitive downhill skier performing a jump landing manoeuvre. Second, sensitivity studies were performed computing 441 landing manoeuvres with perturbed landing height and trunk lean of the skier, and the corresponding effects on peak ACL force were determined. Results The sensitivity studies revealed that peak ACL force increased with jump height and backward lean of the skier as expected. However, peak ACL was about eight times more sensitive to the trunk lean of the skier compared with landing height. The decreased sensitivity of the landing height was based on the lower effects on the knee muscle forces and the shear component of the knee joint reaction force. Conclusion Preventive measures are suggested to focus primarily on avoiding trunk backward lean of the skier, and consequently on proper jump preparation and technique, and secondarily on strategies to reduce landing height during jumps.},

  abstract = {Background There is limited knowledge regarding the incidence of recreational snowboarding-related spinal injuries. Objective This study investigated the incidence and characteristics of recent recreational snowboarding-related spinal injuries and discussed possible preventive measures to reduce the risk of spinal injuries. Methods This descriptive epidemiological study was conducted to investigate the incidence and characteristics of snowboarding-related spinal injuries at the Myoko ski resort in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, between 2006 and 2017. The incidence of spinal injuries was calculated as the total number of spinal injuries divided by the number of snowboarding visitors, which was estimated based on the ticket sales and estimates regarding the ratio of the number of skiers to the number of snowboarders reported by seven skiing facilities. Results In total, 124 (72.5\%) males and 47 (27.5\%) females suffered spinal injuries. The incidence of spinal injuries was 5.1 (95\% CI 4.4 to 5.9) per 100 000 snowboarder visitors. Jumps at terrain parks were the most common factor in 113 (66.1\%) spinal injuries, regardless of skill level (29/49 beginners, 78/112 intermediates, 6/10 experts). Overall, 11 (including 9 Frankel A) of 14 (78.6\%) cases with residual neurologic deficits were involved with jumps. Conclusions In recreational snowboarding, jumping is one of the main causes for serious spinal injuries, regardless of skill level. The incidence of spinal injuries has not decreased over time. Individual efforts and educational interventions thus far have proven insufficient to reduce the incidence of spinal injury. Ski resorts and the ski industry should focus on designing fail-safe jump features to minimise the risk of serious spinal injury.},

A research study was conducted that focused on the data OSHA accumulated on construction worker accidents involving falls. In the construction industry, falls are the most frequently occurring types of accidents resulting in fatalities. The purpose of the study was to identify the root causes of fall accidents and to identify any additional information that might be helpful in reducing the incidence of construction worker falls in the future. While data from January 1990 through October 2001 were examined, particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents that occurred in the last 5 years of this time interval, a period when more data were accumulated and coded in the OSHA investigation reports. Results show that most fall accidents take place at elevations of less than 9.15 m ͑30 ft͒, occurring primarily on new construction projects of commercial buildings and residential projects of relatively low construction cost. Furthermore, experience does not seem to diminish accident occurrence; hazards are often misjudged by workers; and various other patterns can also be observed. Most alarming, the results show that fall accidents account for a growing proportion of the total number of construction worker fatalities.},

The model consists of skis, legs, torso and head, and arms. Inputs include net joint torques that are used to vary the relative body configurations of the jumper during flight. The model also relies on aerodynamic data from previous wind tunnel tests that incorporate the effects of varying body configuration and orientation on lift, drag, and pitching moment. A symbolic manipulation program, ``Macsyma,'' is used to derive the equations of motion automatically. Experimental body segment orientation data during the flight phase are presented for three ski jumpers which show how jumpers of varying ability differ in flight and demonstrate the need for a more complex analytical model than that previously presented in the literature. Simulations are presented that qualitatively match the measured trajectory for a good jumper. The model can be used as a basis for the study of optimal jumper behavior in flight which maximizes jump distance.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It has also been shown that the severity of impact risk can be characterized by equivalent fall height (EFH), a measure of jumper impact velocity normal to the slope, and that design algorithms exist to calculate landing-surface shapes that limit EFH to arbitrarily low values. Although proposals have been made recently to introduce design, the skiing industry and other authors have objected that analysis, design, and standards are impossible because of various ``uncontrollable'' factors that allegedly make the problem intractable to analytical design techniques. We consider the list of uncontrollable factors one by one and show that, to the contrary, each is either: (1) irrelevant to design, (2) has negligible effect, if any, on designed EFH, or (3) can be directly incorporated into the design process.},

In a first step to provide a proof-of-principle example, we designed and built a novel constant equivalent fall height (EFH) snow park jump at the Tognola Ski Resort in San Martino di Castrozza, Italy. The impact performance of this jump and that of an existing standard tabletop jump were measured using a jumper on a snowboard instrumented with accelerometers. Using only the accelerometer channel perpendicular to the snowboard plane, we were able to estimate the velocity changes at impact perpendicular to the landing surface, the corresponding EFH, and approximate values of the energy absorbed on impact. These were found to be in rough agreement with the theoretical expectations for EFH derived from the measured jump profiles, including trends for the tabletop jump EFH as a function of distance jumped that have been described in the literature.},

Objective To evaluate epidemiologic trends in new spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in the United States over 3 decades. Design Consecutive case series. Setting Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems (MSCIS) facilities. Participants Persons (N=30,532) admitted to MSCIS facilities within 365 days of injury between 1973 and 2003, and enrolled in the National Spinal Cord Injury Database. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measures Data were collected at MSCIS admission and rehabilitation discharge. Variables included age, gender, race and ethnic group, year of injury, and level and extent of injury. Specific etiologies were grouped as motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), violence, falls, sports, and other. Demographic and injury severity trends were analyzed by year of injury groupings according to decades (1973\textendash 1979, 1980\textendash 1989, 1990\textendash 1999, 2000\textendash 2003.) Chi-square tests assessed statistical significance. One-way analysis of variance compared mean ages. Results The male/female ratio remained fairly stable at 4:1, but the percentage of women increased slightly over time, especially from MVC etiologies (P{$<$}.001). Over time, the mean age at injury increased significantly (P{$<$}.001); it was 37.7{$\pm$}17.5 years in 2000\textendash 2003. The majority of cases were white (66.1\%). Tetraplegia (54.1\%) and complete injuries (55.6\%) occurred more than paraplegia and incomplete injuries, respectively. MVCs (45.6\%) remained the most common etiology; falls (19.6\%) held the second position over violence (17.8\%), except for the 1990\textendash 1999 period when the positions were reversed. Significantly increasing percentages of new injuries were seen for SCI due to automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, and all-terrain vehicle crashes, blunt object attacks, snow skiing, and medical and surgical mishaps. Conclusions Many previously seen SCI demographic trends continued into the 2000 decade.},

  abstract = {Alpine skiing is a popular sport with significant risk of injury. Since the 1970s, injury rates have dropped from approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 skier-days to about 2 to 3 per 1000 skier-days. The nature of the injuries has also been transformed over the same period. Lower leg injuries are becoming less common while the incidence of knee sprains and upper extremity injuries is becoming more common. Much of this change can be attributed to advancements in binding technology, which effectively reduces lower leg injury, but does not adequately address the issue of knee sprains. Along with design, binding adjustment and maintenance are important preventative factors. Poorly adjusted bindings have been correlated with increased injury rates. Upper extremity injuries constitute approximately one-third of skiing injuries, with ulnar collateral ligament sprains and shoulder injuries being the most common. Strategies to prevent these include proper poling technique and avoidance of non-detachable ski pole retention devices. Spinal injuries in skiers have been traditionally much less common than in snowboarders, but this disparity is likely to diminish with the recent trend of incorporating snowboarding moves into skiing. Strategies to help reduce these injuries include promoting the development of terrain parks and focussing on proper technique during such moves. Head injuries have been increasing in incidence over recent decades and account for more than half of skiing-related deaths. The issue of ski helmets remains controversial while evidence for their efficacy remains under debate. There is no evidence to demonstrate that traditional ski instruction reduces injury frequency. More specific programmes focussed on injury prevention techniques are effective. The question of pre-season conditioning to prevent injuries needs further research to demonstrate efficacy.},

This paper provides a natural rationale for selection of the least expensive (minimum snow budget) one of these that nevertheless satisfies other design constraints, mainly limited normal acceleration and jerk during approach and landing transitions. Choosing the maximum allowable normal acceleration during the approach transition brings the entire infinite family of landing surfaces as close as possible to the parent slope. Limiting the rate of change of normal acceleration (jerk) decreases the likelihood of loss of balance at takeoff and consequent catastrophic spinal cord injuries on landing. An analogous choice, satisfying limited normal acceleration during the landing transition, selects the single member of the infinite family (providing the desired EFH) that lies closest to the parent slope and is therefore least costly to build. Software in the form of a graphical user interface is described that implements these algorithms and is appropriate for inexperienced users to calculate design details before actual fabrication of landing surfaces at a specific jump site.},

Use of wrist protection devices reduced injuries to the wrist from 2 to 0.5\% (p = 0.048).         Conclusion~         Risk of snowboard related injury was highest in beginners. Through the use of wrist protection devices, the incidence of the most common injuries was dramatically reduced.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the magnitude and frequency content of surface-measured accelerations at each major human body segment from foot to head during impact landings. Twelve males performed two single leg drop landings from each of 0.15 m, 0.30 m, and 0.45 m. Triaxial accelerometers (2000 Hz) were positioned over the: first metatarsophalangeal joint; distal anteromedial tibia; superior to the medial femoral condyle; L5 vertebra; and C6 vertebra. Analysis of acceleration signal power spectral densities revealed two distinct components, 2-14 Hz and 14-58 Hz, which were assumed to correspond to time domain signal joint rotations and elastic wave tissue deformation, respectively. Between each accelerometer position from the metatarsophalangeal joint to the L5 vertebra, signals exhibited decreased peak acceleration, increased time to peak acceleration, and decreased power spectral density integral of both the 2-14 Hz and 14-58 Hz components, with no further attenuation beyond the L5 vertebra. This resulted in peak accelerations close to vital organs of less than 10\% of those at the foot. Following landings from greater heights, peak accelerations measured distally were greater, as was attenuation prior to the L5 position. Active and passive mechanisms within the lower limb therefore contribute to progressive attenuation of accelerations, preventing excessive accelerations from reaching the torso and head, even when distal accelerations are large.},

One especially hazardous situation is when the jumper lands in an inverted position which can lead to catastrophic injury or death from spinal cord trauma. Whereas jumpers can execute inverted maneuvers intentionally, curvature in the takeoff can lead to involuntary inversion. In this work we lay out the basic physics of this phenomenon assuming a rigid body model which simulates a stiff-legged jumper. Included is an estimate of the partially compensating (forward) rotation caused by the ground reaction force. I apply the results to an actual jump having a curved takeoff. For a jump trajectory with a landing just past the ``knuckle,'' the resulting net angle of inverting rotation is found to be about 60 , sufficiently large to pose a potential injury risk. A mitigating takeoff design criterion adopted by the U.S. Terrain Park Council based on human response times is also discussed and compared to the FIS standard for Nordic jumps.},

  abstract = {Introduction Trampolines are responsible for specific injuries. We examined the severity of these injuries in children compared with those occurring in other activities. Our primary goal was to compare the injury severity between trampolining and other activities. Our secondary goal was to evaluate risk factors for severity in order to establish preventative measures and, third, to evaluate the increased prevalence of these injuries in our hospital from 2008 to 2016. Material and methods Our study was a retrospective, comparative, descriptive, and epidemiological research. Children aged 2\textendash 15 years admitted to our traumatology emergency services between June and October 2016 were included in the study. Non-sport-related injuries were excluded. Serious injuries were classified as fractures and admissions to the operating room. Results In total, 1106 children were admitted including 107 trampoline accidents. The fracture rate was similar in the two groups: 34 (31.78\%) vs. 309 (30.93\%), OR=1.039, 95\% CI [0.65, 1.62] P=0.91. Surgical treatments were more frequent in the trampoline group: 4 (3.74\%) vs. 18 (1.80\%) OR=2.114, 95\% CI [0.51, 6.58] P=0.156. Several people jumping simultaneously on the trampoline was a risk factor (OR=1.56, 95\% CI [1.0908, 2.308], P=0.018). Parental supervision was a protective factor (OR=0.271, 95\% CI [0.08, 0.80], P=0.023). Trampolining accidents were 9.7 times more common in our center in 2016 compared with 2008. Discussion To our knowledge, no study has compared trampoline injuries with those stemming from other activities. Awareness campaigns are needed as well as information from sellers, who have to be trained. Conclusion Surgical treatments are twice as likely in trampoline accidents. Prevention is simple: Children should be alone on the trampoline and supervised by an adult.},

  abstract = {The use of muscles as power dissipators is investigated in this study, both from the modellistic and the experimental points of view. Theoretical predictions of the drop landing manoeuvre for a range of initial conditions have been obtained by accounting for the mechanical characteristics of knee extensor muscles, the limb geometry and assuming maximum neural activation. Resulting dynamics have been represented in the phase plane (vertical displacement versus speed) to better classify the damping performance. Predictions of safe landing in sedentary subjects were associated to dropping from a maximum (feet) height of 1.6-2.0 m (about 11 m on the moon). Athletes can extend up to 2.6-3.0 m, while for obese males (m = 100 kg, standard stature) the limit should reduce to 0.9-1.3 m. These results have been calculated by including in the model the estimated stiffness of the `global elastic elements' acting below the squat position. Experimental landings from a height of 0.4, 0.7, 1.1 m (sedentary males (SM) and male (AM) and female (AF) athletes from the alpine ski national team) showed dynamics similar to the model predictions. While the peak power (for a drop height of about 0.7 m) was similar in SM and AF (AM shows a + 40\% increase, about 33 W/kg), AF stopped the downward movement after a time interval (0.219{$\pm$}0.030 s) from touch-down 20\% significantly shorter than SM.

  abstract = {Background. Skiing and snowboarding are popular competitive and recreational sports with associated head injury risks from impact hazards. Understanding head injury hazards and risks in snow sports can inform injury prevention measures, such as helmets, education and environment design of runs and terrain park features, to manage injury risk. Aim. To identify and discuss (a) the proportion and incidence of head injuries and effectiveness of helmets, (b) circumstances, situational events and characteristics of head injuries and (c) head impact biomechanics in recreational skiing and snowboarding. Methods. A narrative literature review was performed. Results. Head injuries comprise up to 38\% and 29\% of all injuries in skiing and snowboarding, respectively. Skull fractures were found to comprise nearly half of all moderate to severe head injuries in alpine sports across all studies. The most common intracranial injury in skiing and snowboarding was cerebral contusion and subdural haematoma, respectively. Fatal head injuries in skiing are rare with an incidence of approximately one death per one million skier-visits and less than 1\% of all skiing head injuries resulted in death. The majority of head injuries were sustained by novice and intermediate level skiers and snowboarders during falls on mild or moderate gradient slopes. Head injury cases occurred in terrain parks were more common in snowboarders than skiers. Fall-related head injuries to skiers are typically in the forward direction with an impact to the front of the head, whereas snowboarders fall rearward and impact the occipital region. Helmet use has increased in recent years, but recent studies have observed an unexpected reduction of the protective effect of helmets in skiing and snowboarding. Alpine sports helmet standards require linear drops onto rigid anvils, but the correlation with snow surfaces is unknown and no helmet standard requires an oblique impact test. Significant protective effects of helmets have been found for collisions and falls onto hard snow. Conclusions. Alpine sport helmet performance standards should more closely reflect the boundary conditions of impacts to skiers and snowboarders associated with head injury. Administrative and engineering controls may also reduce the risk of head injury in skiing and snowboarding.},

The purpose of this study was to determine differences in injury patterns and severity between children participating in these sports treated at trauma centers in the United States. Methods Ski and snowboard injuries in children {$<$}15 identified from the 2011\textendash 2015 National Trauma Data Bank were compared using t tests, chi squared tests, and multivariable analyses. Time trends were evaluated using the Cochran Armitage trend test. Results We identified 1613 injured snowboarders and 1655 skiers. Snowboarders were older (12 vs. 11years, p{$<$}.001) and more likely to be male (84 vs. 68\%, p{$<$}.001). The proportion of ski to snowboard injuries increased over time (p{$<$}.001). Skiers had greater median ISS than snowboarders (5 vs. 4, p{$<$}.001) but similar severe injuries ISS {$\geq$}16 (9 vs. 8\%, p=.31). Head injuries were more frequent among snowboarders (26 vs. 23\%, p=.013). Helmet use was greater in skiers (46 vs. 34\%, p{$<$}.001). Skiers were more likely to sustain face, chest, and lower extremity injuries. Snowboarders had more abdominal and upper extremity injuries (p{$<$}.05). Snowboarders were more likely to undergo CT (20 vs. 16\%, p=.008), and skiers were more likely to undergo surgery (25 vs. 22\% p=.021). Need for intensive care (12 vs. 13\%, p=.43) and mortality (0.3 vs. 0.3\%, p=.75) were similar. Median length of stay was greater for skiers (2 days vs. 1day, p{$<$}.001). Conclusion Many children are treated at United States trauma centers for ski and snowboard injuries. One in 10 is severely injured. Different injury patterns between sports can be used to tailor prevention efforts. However, avoiding head injury and improving helmet use should be a priority for all children on the slopes.

  abstract = {Females aged between 13-17 years possess the highest non-contact ACL injury incidence of any sex-age strata. Considering that energy absorption strategies have been associated with a reduced risk for sustaining an ACL injury, evaluating landing performance in youth athletes requires investigations beyond the kinematic level. The purpose of this study was to identify sex-specific energy absorption strategies in adolescent males and females, including the relationship between strength and the observed strategies. Thirty-one healthy adolescent athletes completed unanticipated single-leg drop-jump landings on their dominant limb. Sex-specific kinematics and lower-limb contributions to energy absorption were then compared over the landing phase for each jump. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients determined the relationship between isometric joint strength and the observed kinematics and energy absorption. Female participants absorbed a larger proportion of the landing energy at the ankle (p=0.046, d=0.75) and smaller proportion at the hip (p=0.028, d=0.85) compared to males. Females also reached larger peak negative joint power in their knee (p=0.001, d=1.1) and ankle (p=0.04, d=0.79). Hip extension strength was positively correlated with trunk flexion (r=0.559, p=0.001) and negatively correlated with forward pelvic tilt (r=-0.513, p=0.003). Females adopted an energy absorption strategy which utilized the distal joints to absorb a larger portion of the landing forces and tended to absorb the forces later in the landing phase relative to males. The greater reliance on distal joints is correlated to reduced hip strength and may increase the risk for sustaining an ACL injury.},

  abstract = {Background Data on the injury and illness risk among young elite athletes are of utmost importance, because injuries and illnesses can counter the beneficial effects of sports participation at a young age, if children or adolescents are unable to continue to participate because of residual effects of injury or chronic illness. Objective To analyse the frequencies and characteristics of injuries and illnesses during the 2012 Innsbruck Winter Youth Olympic Games (IYOG). Methods We employed the International Olympic Committee (IOC) injury surveillance system for multisport events, which was updated for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver 2010. All National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were asked to report the daily occurrence (or non-occurrence) of newly sustained injuries and illnesses on a standardised reporting form. In addition, information on athletes treated for injuries and illnesses by the Local Organizing Committee medical services was retrieved from the medical centre at the Youth Olympic Village and from the University hospital in Innsbruck. Results Among the 1021 registered athletes (45\% women, 55\% men) from 69 NOCs, a total of 111 injuries and 86 illnesses, during the IYOG, were reported, resulting in an incidence of 108.7 injuries and 84.2 illnesses per 1000 registered athletes, respectively. Injury frequency was highest in skiing in the halfpipe (44\%) and snowboarding (halfpipe and slope style: 35\%), followed by ski cross (17\%), ice hockey (15\%), alpine skiing (14\%) and figure skating (12\%), taking into account the respective number of participating athletes. Knee, pelvis, head, lower back and shoulders were the most common injury locations. About 60\% of injuries occurred in competition and about 40\% in training, respectively. In total, 32\% of the injuries resulted in an absence from training or competition. With regard to illnesses, 11\% of women and 6\% of men suffered from an illness (RR=1.84 (95\% CI 1.21 to 2.78), p=0.003). The respiratory system was affected most often (61\%). Conclusions Eleven per cent of the athletes suffered from an injury and 9\% from illnesses, during the IYOG. The presented data constitute the basis for future analyses of injury mechanisms and associated risk factors in Olympic Winter sports, which, in turn, will be essential to develop and implement effective preventive strategies for young elite winter-sport athletes.},

  abstract = {In alpine winter sports, external risk factors as snow and weather conditions as well as slope characteristics (width, steepness, slope intersections, and snow parks) should be considered when investigating potential risk factors. Therefore, ski patrol injury reports were used to compare factors associated with injuries occurred on slope intersections and in snow parks compared to on-slope injuries. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that in comparison to injuries occurring on ski slopes, collisions with other persons (OR: 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.3\textendash 3.4) and arm injuries (OR: 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.3\textendash 3.5) were more likely associated with injuries occurring on slope intersections while male gender (OR: 3.5, 95\% CI: 2.1\textendash 5.7), younger age (OR: 1.1, 95\% CI: 1.0\textendash 1.1), slushy/soft snow conditions (OR: 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.1\textendash 3.3), knee injuries (OR: 0.4, 95\% CI: 0.2\textendash 0.8) and back injuries (OR: 5.5, 95\% CI: 3.0\textendash 10.2) were more likely associated with injuries which occurred in snow parks. In conclusion, injuries on slope intersections and in snow parks differ in some factors from injuries sustained on ski slopes.},

  abstract = {Background Snowboarding is a popular albeit risky sport and terrain park (TP) injuries are more severe than regular slope injuries. TPs contain man-made features that facilitate aerial manoeuvres. The objectives of this study were to determine overall and feature-specific injury rates and the potential risk factors for TP injuries. Methods Case\textendash control study with exposure estimation, conducted in an Alberta TP during two ski seasons. Cases were snowboarders injured in the TP who presented to ski patrol and/or local emergency departments. Controls were uninjured snowboarders in the same TP. {$\kappa$} Statistics were used to measure the reliability of reported risk factor information. Injury rates were calculated and adjusted logistic regression was used to calculate the feature-specific odds of injury. Results Overall, 333 cases and 1261 controls were enrolled. Reliability of risk factor information was {$\kappa>$}0.60 for 21/24 variables. The overall injury rate was 0.75/1000 runs. Rates were highest for jumps and halfpipe (both 2.56/1000 runs) and lowest for rails (0.43/ 1000 runs) and quarter-pipes (0.24/1000 runs). Compared with rails, there were increased odds of injury for half-pipe (OR 9.63; 95\% CI 4.80 to 19.32), jumps (OR 4.29; 95\% CI 2.72 to 6.76), mushroom (OR 2.30; 95\% CI 1.20 to 4.41) and kickers (OR 1.99; 95\% CI 1.27 to 3.12). Conclusions Higher feature-specific injury rates and increased odds of injury were associated with features that promote aerial manoeuvres or a large drop to the ground. Further research is required to determine ways to increase snowboarder safety in the TP.},

  abstract = {The performance of individuals jumping tabletop features in terrain parks has not been widely studied. A field study was conducted to measure the takeoff speed and horizontal distance achieved by jumpers at two tabletop style jump features: A smaller jump at Snow Summit, CA and a larger jump at Mammoth Mountain, CA, USA. Analyses were also conducted to determine the effects of equipment type ͑skis versus snowboard͒ on jumper kinematics. Before each data collection session, the physical dimensions of the jump were measured and recorded. For consecutive jumpers, the speed parallel to the ramp was measured at the end of the takeoff by using a laser speed trap accurate to 0.11 m/s. The landing zone was marked at 3.0 m intervals with colored dye, beginning just past the flat deck portion of the jump. A high-definition video camera was used to record the landing of each jumper, and the landing point of the projected center of mass was determined by using photogrammetry, accurate to within 5 cm. The actual landing distances measured in the field were compared to predicted landing distances by using ordinary ballistic equations. A total of 280 jumps was observed on the two features: 105 on skis and 175 on snowboards. The correlation coefficients between the square of the takeoff speed and the landing distance for the smaller and larger jumps were 0.75 ͑R2ϭ0.56͒ and 0.41 ͑R2ϭ0.16͒, respectively. The measured landing distances differed significantly from those predicted by models using the ballistic equations of motion. The average landing distance beyond the knuckle was 2.4 m on the smaller jump and 2.1 m on the larger jump. For both features, skier and snowboarder jumpers did not differ in average landing distance.},

  abstract = {Terrain park tabletop jumps have a shape that is common at many ski areas today. A safe, low-impact landing on any jump with a constant linear landing area requires that the component of jumper velocity perpendicular to the landing surface be small, and when velocities are large, achieving this requires that the jumper flight path angle be nearly equal to the landing surface angle. Landing impact severity can alternatively be measured using the equivalent fall height (EFH). Based on Newton's laws and assumed ballistic flight, this research presents a general expression for the EFH experienced by a jumper when landing at any possible point on any landing surface whatsoever. This general expression is then particularized to show the effects on the EFH of the four physical features of a generic tabletop jump with a flat, horizontal deck and a constant linear landing region: the takeoff angle h0, the coordinates of the knuckle xt and yt where the intended constant-slope landing region begins, and the snow landing surface angle u in this region. Numerical results show that tabletop jump EFHs have increasing and possibly large values near the ends of both the tabletop and the linear landing downslope portions. We conclude that tabletop jumps do not exhibit a low impulse on landing everywhere, which increases the likelihood of jumper injuries relative to those jumps for which the EFH is small everywhere.},

During two seasons (1994 to 1995 and 1995 to 1996), 34 skiers and 22 snowboarders suffered serious spinal injuries (fracture or neurologic deficit or both) at two ski areas in British Columbia, Canada. Ski patrol records, the Provincial Trauma Database, and hospital records were reviewed. Injury rates were based on computerized lift-ticket data and a population estimate of 15\% snowboarders (ski patrol observation). The incidence of spinal injury among skiers was 0.01 per 1000 skier-days, and among snowboarders was 0.04 per 1000 snowboarder-days. Mean age was 34.5 years for skiers and 22.4 years for snowboarders. Seventy percent of the skiers were men, whereas all of the snowboarders were men. Jumping (intentional jump 2 meters) was the cause of injury in 20\% of skiers and 77\% of snowboarders. Neither age nor sex accounted for any significant portion of this difference. The rate of spinal injuries among snowboarders is fourfold that among skiers. Although jumping is the primary cause of injury, it is an intrinsic element of snowboarding. Until research defines effective injury-prevention strategies, knowledge of the risk of snowboarding should be disseminated and techniques for safe jumping should be taught.},

In Boston and New York, public health efforts have successfully decreased window fall injuries. Local data are needed to develop appropriate interventions for Chicago. Objective: To describe the housing characteristics and types of injuries among children who fell from windows treated in a Chicago pediatric trauma center. Methods: Children treated in a pediatric trauma center for injuries related to window falls between 1995 and 2002 were identified retrospectively. We reviewed family demographics, the circumstances of the fall, and types of injuries. Site visits were performed to determine the height and type of building and type of window where the fall took place. Results: The authors reviewed 90 cases; 55 were male. The median age was 2 years. Ninety eight percent of falls were reported to be from the third floor or lower. Site visits (n = 77) showed that 96\% of the buildings were four storeys or lower. The median length of hospital stay was two days (range 0\textendash 24 days). The most common injuries were head trauma and extremity fractures. Three patients died, and an additional three patients were discharged to rehabilitation centers. Conclusions: Some window falls result in serious injury. In Chicago, most falls were from modest heights (2nd/3rd floor windows) in buildings of four or fewer storeys, rather than from ``high rises''. Strategies to prevent window falls should be directed to the owners and occupants of this type of housing.},
