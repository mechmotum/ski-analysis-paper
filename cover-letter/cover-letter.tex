\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

Attached is an original article submission for the Journal of Sports Sciences
titled ``Online Software and Ethical Issues for Safety-Conscious Design of
Terrain Park Jumps''. The article concerns the effect of snow sports jumps on
athlete safety using theoretical approaches. We frame the results and use of
the computational tool in the context of public health and we use sports
biomechanics modeling to quantify injury risk. These findings are important for
the ski industry and sports participants' welfare. We believe this aligns with
the journal's aims and scope.

The article was submitted to the journal ``Sports Engineering'' in March of
2021 and went through 6 months of peer review there, ultimately being rejected.
The current version of the article has been through four major revisions during
the Sports Engineering with substantial improvements made for the positive
reviews by the three peer reviewers.

The work has not been published before and is not currently under consideration
for publication anywhere else. A preprint is available at
\verb|https://dx.doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/sq7u9|. All co-authors have approved
this submission.

We request that the authors of the three papers [37, 52, 53] we strongly
critique in Section 4.1 are not selected as reviewers. We prefer to minimize
any undue bias that could affect the publication decision. The authors are:
Irving Scher, Jasper E. Shealy, Stepan Lenka, Erin Harley, Reed Thomas, Ryan
Hoover, Robert J. Johnson, John A. Rice.

Lastly, we understand this article may be atypical and kindly request rejection
before entering the lengthy peer review process if this style of article does
not fit the journal.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{document}
