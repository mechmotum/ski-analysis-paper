\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

Attached is a systematic review article submission for the Injury Prevention
titled ``Online Software and Ethical Issues for Safety-Conscious Design of
Terrain Park Jumps''. The article concerns the effect of snow sports jumps on
athlete safety using theoretical approaches. We frame the results and use of
the computational tool in the context of public health and we use sports
biomechanics modeling to quantify injury risk. These findings are important for
the ski industry and sports participants' welfare. We believe this aligns with
the journal's aims and scope.

The work has not been published before and is not currently under consideration
for publication anywhere else. A preprint is available at
\verb|https://dx.doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/sq7u9|. All co-authors have approved
this submission.

We request that the authors of the three papers [37, 52, 53] we strongly
critique in Section 4.1 are not selected as reviewers. We prefer to minimize
any undue bias that could affect the publication decision. The authors are:
Irving Scher, Jasper E. Shealy, Stepan Lenka, Erin Harley, Reed Thomas, Ryan
Hoover, Robert J. Johnson, and John A. Rice.

\closing{Sincerely,}
