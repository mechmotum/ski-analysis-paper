\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

Attached is an original research article submission for the Journal of Sports
Engineering and Technology titled ``Safety-Conscious Design of Terrain Park
Jumps: Ethical Issues and Online Software''. The article concerns the effect of
snow sports jumps on athlete safety using theoretical approaches. We frame the
results and use of the computational tool in the context of public health and
we use sports biomechanics modeling to quantify injury risk. These findings are
important for the ski industry and sports participants' welfare. We believe
this aligns with the journal's aims and scope; in particular the aim: ``The
development and validation of instrumentation, processes or software to enhance
research activities within sports engineering and technology''.

Our paper may also fit the ``Case Study'' submission type for your journal. If
you feel our paper fits another submission type better, we are happy to change
the type.

The work has not been published before and is not currently under consideration
for publication anywhere else. A preprint is available at
\verb|https://dx.doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/sq7u9|. All co-authors have approved
this submission.

We request that the authors of the three papers [37, 52, 53] we strongly
critique in Section 4.1 are not selected as reviewers. We prefer to minimize
any undue bias that could affect the publication decision. The authors are:
Irving Scher, Jasper E. Shealy, Stepan Lenka, Erin Harley, Reed Thomas, Ryan
Hoover, Robert J. Johnson, and John A. Rice.

\closing{Sincerely,}
